# Team Context for Summary Generation

This file provides context on key team members to help prioritize highlights in weekly summaries.

## Leadership & High-Impact Feedback

**Helen** - VP of Product & Design (Kate's Manager)
- Any feedback from Helen is career-critical
- Mentorship moments, performance feedback, strategic guidance all highly significant

**Adam** - CTO & Co-founder
- Kate doesn't report to Adam, but works closely with him on priorities and product decisions
- "Really calls the shots over almost anyone else"
- Strategic decisions and product direction conversations are highly significant

**Drew** - CEO & Co-founder
- Less frequent interactions than Adam, but very important when they happen
- Feedback from Drew carries great weight

## Kate's Growth Priorities

**Hannah** - Kate's Direct Report
- Kate's first direct report - mentorship moments are top-tier highlights
- Focus on: coaching, delegation, Hannah's wins, Kate's ability to mentor and guide
- This is one of Kate's top priorities right now

**Data Team - Jerry, Andrew, Michael**
- Kate wants to insert more product guidance and mentorship into their work
- Instances where Kate is guiding/mentoring them show expanding influence beyond direct reports

## Regular Collaborators

**Shane** - Product Marketing Manager
- Works closely with Kate to launch features
- Launch partnerships are important but more routine (note unless major)

**Emily** - Growth Product Manager
- Peer collaboration
- Note significant strategic decisions or cross-pillar coordination

**Angela, Angel, Craig** - Designers
- Product development work
- Note when significant design decisions are made

## Summary Prioritization Guidelines

When generating summaries, prioritize:
1. **Any feedback/decisions from Helen, Adam, or Drew** - These are career-critical
2. **Mentorship moments with Hannah** - Coaching, delegation, her wins (first direct report!)
3. **Instances of guiding the data team** - Shows expanding influence
4. **Strategic product decisions** - Especially with Adam
5. **Operational improvements and process changes** - How we work, team enablement, increasing impact
   - Examples: New tools/integrations that improve team insights (like Attention in Pylon)
   - Process improvements that change how the team operates
   - Initiatives to increase team effectiveness or product impact
6. **Cross-functional strategic pivots** - When they change direction meaningfully

Note briefly but don't over-emphasize:
- Regular planning sessions (unless major decision made)
- Design reviews (unless significant pivot)
- Routine launch coordination (unless it's a major release)
- Standard 1:1s (unless specific feedback or career moment)
