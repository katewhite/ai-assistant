## Transcript

**Kate:** Hello.

**Adam:** How's it going?

**Kate:** Not.

**Kate:** Bad. How are you?

**Adam:** Good.

**Adam:** All my head.

**Adam:** Ings. I didn't have my computer in front of me.

**Adam:** When the standups were going. So many slides. Okay, I'll turn it to be distracted.

**Kate:** Sorry. Yeah.

**Adam:** Happy new year's.

**Kate:** Same. How are your holidays?

**Adam:** Awesome. So glad.

**Adam:** My phys went back to school today.

**Adam:** Because yesterday was like teacher teacher or something day workshops.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And it was like dropping them off at school.

**Adam:** Such a relief.

**Kate:** Yeah, you're telling me. They were home yesterday, which is so nice that I'm home and they can be home and it's fine, but it's just, like, such a distraction. And then if it's not a distraction, it's like I leave my office and it looks like a bomb went off in the house with just all their crap because they haven't had.

**Kate:** Supervision all day. So anyway.

**Adam:** We went for some ass with another family. I think this thesis.

**Adam:** Was.

**Adam:** It would be like sort of we would get economies of scale.

**Adam:** Like more children.

**Adam:** And we'd be able to all do our own thing and have time off. And one or two parents would be the children.

**Adam:** But between the altitude, I think causing our kids not to sleep very well. So both of us had a six month old.

**Adam:** And neither six month old slept.

**Adam:** At all the whole time.

**Adam:** 6aM would roll around and we would finally.

**Adam:** Stumble out of our bedrooms. Bloodshot just already cranky. It was like 6aM Every day.

**Adam:** And then our kids.

**Adam:** There was just a lot of.

**Adam:** Kids violence and not sharing, and they're not actually hurting each other, but there's tears and we should parent in this situation, and we're so tired.

**Adam:** So I think we're still friends with them.

**Adam:** But I understand if we all need a break from for a couple of weeks.

**Kate:** I get that.

**Kate:** And like just being. Yeah. Even if you are friends and good friends, being in the same house with other families is always a lot.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** I read something about the unicorn family or unicorn friends.

**Kate:** Is like the parents and the kids, I guess. Wife, husband and kids get along. It's, like, so incredibly difficult to find that setup.

**Adam:** And we have that.

**Adam:** That is this family for us.

**Adam:** We both have a six month old. Obviously they don't get along.

**Adam:** Yet.

**Adam:** We bought them a two year old. They're in the same preschool class.

**Kate:** Oh.

**Kate:** Nice.

**Adam:** And then the four year old is like,

**Adam:** He's down, and then me and the guy. He's probably my top two or three closest guy friends in Denver. I'm on his softball team now, and we hang. And my wife and his wife are probably the closest out of all those relationships. So it's like.

**Adam:** I've never heard that term unicorn friends, but it is a unicorn friend situation.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** But yeah, it was like one thing that was just like. It was like his parents house smelled as so there were like a lot of rules.

**Adam:** And he was trying to enforce the rules. It was like his parents.

**Adam:** House, and then our kids weren't following the rules, so we felt like we had to enforce the rules, that he had to enforce the rules on our kids. So that also created an interesting dynamic.

**Kate:** Y.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Kate:** Totally. Yeah.

**Kate:** So fun.

**Adam:** Cool. So we don't have a full time design.

**Adam:** But I don't know if we need it entirely, but.

**Adam:** I don't know. I don't even have an agenda, but, like, a handful of.

**Adam:** Things one would love to just get your input on some meaning.

**Adam:** Like, cadences this week. And, like, what do you want to join?

**Adam:** Didn't put you in a couple meetings, but, like, I think it might be worth bringing you in. Question is, like, temporarily, permanently, do you want to try and, like,

**Adam:** Carve out some space for yourself. Join the means. Right. So. So I think that's one.

**Adam:** To just sort of, like, checking in on some of these projects.

**Adam:** And then three check in on people. Hannah and Jerrica.

**Adam:** Anything else from the other side?

**Kate:** Co.

**Kate:** Ol?

**Kate:** No, that pretty much aligns with what was on my mind.

**Kate:** And just like, kind of.

**Kate:** You and I.

**Kate:** And responsibilities, it sounds like, all overlapping. Like since Helen's gone.

**Kate:** And what things have already felt like since then and that type of thing. But I think, yeah, that's going to weave into all the topics that you just mentioned.

**Adam:** I think it's been, like, two days since Helen's been gone.

**Kate:** Technically.

**Adam:** But yeah.

**Adam:** Cool.

**Adam:** What's that like?

**Adam:** Rocks and initiatives.

**Adam:** I don't know. I mean, I feel like if I start talking, I won't stop.

**Adam:** So, like, give you the mic for anything that, like, is on, on your mind that you want to talk about regarding that stuff.

**Kate:** No, not really. Honestly, it's more on the.

**Kate:** How.

**Kate:** We operate now with the initiatives more than just themselves, if I'm being honest.

**Adam:** Great.

**Adam:** Okay?

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** That's part of this.

**Kate:** Yeah, A kind of change of org structure and, for example.

**Kate:** Getting more into the weeds.

**Kate:** Like we have this leads weekly meeting this afternoon where we're supposed to go over okrs.

**Kate:** Cool for me to go over the okrs for mine. Hannah's and Jericho's in that call. Or should it be a higher level?

**Kate:** Okr thing.

**Kate:** That's.

**Kate:** Like again, just more of a tactical question.

**Kate:** And then in general. Yeah, like these pillars.

**Kate:** And. And the pillar sinks.

**Kate:** And you're leading all of those sinks.

**Kate:** But I need to be in tune to, like, what Hannah and Jerric are up to and what's going on there. And so I'm kind of, like, a little confused. So at the moment,

**Kate:** And almost anxious, if I'm being honest and blunt.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Like, what do you own? What do I own?

**Kate:** Where can I, like, take more of your Legos from you and be as helpful as possible? How can I build the trust in you to then take those Legos? That's kind of my.

**Kate:** Where my head's at at the moment is more on the operational kind of almost relationship side of all of this.

**Kate:** And how I can be of most help to both Hannah and Jerrica, as well as you.

**Adam:** Okay?

**Adam:** Perfect.

**Adam:** What's up with, like.

**Adam:** I want to own as little as possible, and I feel like I have, like,

**Adam:** One thing that.

**Adam:** And I would love for you to help me figure out the right balance here and really be honest with me.

**Adam:** One thing that I know that I struggle with.

**Adam:** And.

**Adam:** Will continue to try and find the right balance of is. Like, where do I inject myself?

**Adam:** And where do I let people have this space?

**Adam:** And.

**Adam:** How to create the right. The right dynamics there.

**Kate:** Y.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** So that's like the thing that I am working on and trying to be the most conscious about. And I would say I probably have.

**Adam:** I know that I have the bias of wanting to inject myself more than I should.

**Adam:** And so.

**Adam:** You know, even the way you said.

**Adam:** All these pillar things, and I'm leading those, like, actually.

**Adam:** I would. I don't want to lead all of those. I.

**Adam:** Like, I think that you lead core, right? Like, I don't know. Like, I think that you leave that. And I'm a participant in all of them, and I want to be, like, updated. I think the purpose of them is, like, let's create.

**Adam:** Let's create alignment so that we're all in sync.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And maybe it can be some thread across all six of them.

**Kate:** Sure.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** But, like.

**Adam:** You own yours.

**Adam:** And so.

**Adam:** What is the like?

**Adam:** What's making you eat like I sense.

**Adam:** Your unease. You're. I said you need to use a term, anxious.

**Kate:** There you.

**Kate:** Go.

**Adam:** What is like? What do you feel is the source of that?

**Kate:** I think it's a lack of understanding of maybe even your expectations. Like, even when you just talk about the pillars. Like, okay, I didn't know that you didn't want to own those calls. But then when we come to them, what do you want to hear? What should we be? And not to be like, so pedantic about, like, the agenda, and you need to tell me X, Y, and Z. But even if you hit, like, blasted the meetings out, I'm not trying to, like, say how you should have done something, but, like, blast the meeting out and say, like, hey.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Having. The purpose of them is xyz. Here's who's going to own the calls.

**Kate:** This would be like an example agenda that would be really helpful for me. Understand, like, we. We had these at customario where it was like every. We had. We called them squads.

**Adam:** Y.

**Adam:** Eah.

**Kate:** Same as pillars, basically. And, like, we had our triads and we all worked together. We had this, like, fantastic autonomy to be like, here's what we're going to do. Here's gonna be our roadmap. I had, like, we had engineers and designs that are designers and product managers.

**Kate:** Working so closely together that we knew who to go to for what and to figure all that stuff out.

**Kate:** And then it was like, I want to say it was biweekly that we would meet with VP of Product.

**Kate:** CEO sometimes even if we need to pull him in, like whoever the higher little stakeholders were to like, here's products we made in last week. And I would have to go back and remember exactly what the like.

**Kate:** Template agenda was kind of like it made a lot of sense, but it felt very like we were owning the.

**Kate:** Squads, and we were just merely communicating back up to stakeholders, coming with questions that we might have for them. What blockers do you have? What decisions do you need being made? That kind of thing.

**Adam:** Y.

**Adam:** Eah.

**Kate:** I don't know if we're there yet. Here, like that level of.

**Kate:** But I. But I do feel like when you said you should be the common thread, I agree with that because I think there's also a lot of.

**Kate:** Nerves around. Like, how are we not going to be overlapping?

**Adam:** Y.

**Adam:** Eah.

**Kate:** Those toes. And so I think the common thread, like, has to be there.

**Kate:** But, like, another example. Sorry, I'm brain dumping now, too, but even this morning, I felt like we were almost repeating the meeting that Craig and I, like, had yesterday. And the third piece was, like, maybe Craig and I just needed to sync up with Carolyn to be like, okay, who can own this tech thing?

**Kate:** But it felt like you were starting to connect dots that, like, Craig and I already had. And so it's like, how do we communicate to you better the dots we're connecting and the thought processes we're having and that type of thing so that you don't feel like.

**Kate:** You have to come in and drive that conversation again. Does that make sense?

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** It makes 100% sense.

**Adam:** I think there was some. I think.

**Adam:** There were some tactics missed, especially on that meeting, Some this morning.

**Adam:** Maybe, like, sharing a little bit of.

**Adam:** What?

**Adam:** Would make me feel great from you.

**Adam:** I'll point you a specific example that you did well, which was like, at the end of the meeting when you were like, craig, if you could send daily updates.

**Adam:** That would make me feel good.

**Adam:** And that coming from you instead of having to come from me.

**Adam:** Felt.

**Adam:** Like, that was, like, probably the biggest.

**Adam:** Exhale like deep breath. Moment I had felt in a while.

**Kate:** Which is fun. It's, like, the reason that I. I have felt like.

**Kate:** And this kind of goes back to the ownership thing, but working with Craig has been a little bit challenging for me, if I'm being honest. Like, I feel like I'm nagging him constantly, like, hey, do you have anything?

**Kate:** Hey, do you have anything? And so part of that was like, I would love to see something every day, even if it's a mess, if it's not the right direction, if it's because otherwise we can't collaborate and help and push each other.

**Kate:** I don't know if it's because he spins on things and, like, wants perfection before he shares or what, so I was trying to communicate.

**Kate:** Like, it's kind of in your court at the moment, and I really want to keep pushing on momentum, but then, like, kind of going back to you versus me. Not you versus me, but, like, who owns.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Before that meeting, I kind of was like, well, maybe Adam will push harder on, like, getting updates and whatnot.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** So that's where the confusion back and forth.

**Kate:** Goes.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Maybe also if I can share a little bit about, like.

**Adam:** Some of my relationship with different people on the team and, like, how things have gone for me over the last couple months.

**Adam:** I have been feeling like. And I think that you got this sense.

**Adam:** I've been saying since about, like, August that I want to prioritize the visual editor.

**Adam:** I felt like it hasn't totally. Like we haven't been making progress. I've been making progress. I like.

**Adam:** I started to, like, take action on it.

**Adam:** And Helen pushed back on me, and she was like, you're short circuiting a process.

**Adam:** Like there's a way to do this. There's a right way and a wrong way.

**Adam:** The wrong way is to just like.

**Adam:** Do whatever comes to your mind because you saw it individually and, like, you want to do it away. And, like, the right way is to, like.

**Adam:** Be thoughtful and do some research and have, like, different versions and, like, think about.

**Adam:** The implications and, like, the. The long term. And that was kind of like what inspired the design Sprint.

**Adam:** That. That we did. And, like, should it be test first or experience first or whatever?

**Adam:** And.

**Adam:** And I was like,

**Adam:** Helen and I.

**Adam:** Had.

**Adam:** Like our biggest.

**Adam:** Ever.

**Adam:** Or only ever, really.

**Adam:** Drama.

**Adam:** But, like, confrontation was like.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Middle or early October. I remember because it was before the board meeting and we, like, resolved that we were in person for the board meeting at the end of October.

**Adam:** But it was like early October.

**Adam:** And I was, like, already feeling like it has either been sort of beating this drum about the visual editor and it hadn't happened, and I was like,

**Adam:** What is a timeline look like? Can we see something in two weeks? And she was like,

**Adam:** She was pushing back on that.

**Adam:** And.

**Adam:** And, like, we had this big blow up moment because, like, she felt like I was trying to short circuit a process.

**Adam:** Anyway.

**Adam:** And then there was a design sprint, and then there was, like, the outcomes design screen. And I feel like the way I feel now is like, we have been thinking and spinning our wheels on this thing since, like, literally August. I don't feel any. Literally, don't feel like we've made any progress.

**Adam:** And when we have started to like. I think Angela did a really nice design on some things. I think that, like, you, like, everyone has done, like, some interesting stuff, but I don't really feel like we have any tactical progress on this thing.

**Adam:** And I like.

**Adam:** And I. And. And I have also felt like every time I try and, like, earn my, like, founder mode on, I get met with this, like,

**Adam:** Resistance. And I also worry that that also, like. And trying to be conscious, to give people, like, their space and to do the process. And I also know that, like, my tendency is to, like, oversimplify and, like, patch things together and then, like,

**Adam:** So I don't know. I am really struggling to find the right balance of, like, I want to push it forward, but I also want to be thoughtful about, like, the whole thing and, like, make sure that it is not. Like, we're not making decisions that may cap us later on down the road.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** And.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** Drive it forward. So anyway, that's, like, where all the, like, all of my comments are. My sense of urgency, like, if we don't do it now, we might not have a chance. It was just like, it's coming from that.

**Kate:** That makes sense.

**Adam:** And it's. And sorry. I know I've been writing up and then, like.

**Adam:** On craig.

**Adam:** Craig is Helen's guy. Like Frank and Helen have a long relationship before Intelligems.

**Adam:** I've always.

**Adam:** Struggled to, like, feel like I understood where Craig is adding value. And I feel like he gets spread across a lot of different things, then ends up not contributing meaningfully. And one thing.

**Adam:** I know he's capable of it. I think he did an amazing job when we did, like, a whole design revamp. This was before you got here.

**Adam:** We like did a whole like we pour everything down. Went back to like components. He built a whole component system that we can use both indesigns and tried to match them in the app to make like a whole design development process both faster and more efficient, more consistent and like more one to one from designs to development, so.

**Adam:** RT of led that project and I think did a really good job of that.

**Adam:** But, like, mostly because of time zones and because of, like, Helen's relationship with him. Like, it has always been Helen.

**Adam:** Who manages craig.

**Adam:** And I don't have the answer of, like.

**Adam:** I also.

**Adam:** Like.

**Adam:** I think that Craig is in a tough spot because, like, he's got a family, he's working these time zones. He's eight hours off from us. I personally just can't get to work before 9:15 and like, I know like year on earlier, so I'm like, hopefully that's able. To make alleviate some of that pressure.

**Adam:** But, like, it's really tough. And, like, I also worry that, like.

**Adam:** Craig's not going to be here in six months if, like, we don't get into a rhythm that works for him.

**Adam:** And so.

**Adam:** I don't know. And I think that that would.

**Adam:** Be both. Losing Craig and Helen, I think would in. In this, in a short period of time would be a big loss to this organization.

**Adam:** So. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

**Adam:** Everything on the. On the table for me.

**Kate:** Super, super helpful context, and I really appreciate you sharing it all so transparently. For what it's worth, from, like, my perspective, I had no idea that anything was happening with Visual Editor in August or October or November anyway, like, ever. Until I heard, like, maybe Hannah and Angela were starting to do some, like, customer calls around it, and that was the first I heard of it.

**Kate:** So I think, like,

**Kate:** That might have been that that's just my perspective. But this feels like brand new to me. So I am appreciating and definitely acknowledging the urgency.

**Kate:** Around it. And I kind of hear where Helen's coming from. But I. I would also say, like, I think the pillars, and I'm going to continue to call them, like, strategic initiatives, because that's how I see them.

**Kate:** Is like was super helpful and insightful in directing us all the correct way. And that feels like the exact.

**Kate:** Like when you.

**Kate:** Came out with those. It was like, hell, yeah. Like, this is what a founder should be doing, like, telling us what our initiatives, a strategic initiatives are for the quarter, and then we kind of like, own them and figure out where we want to take them, Obviously. Visual Editor.

**Kate:** In part because you were pushing hard on it, which is totally fair, but also because we did all this component exploration work, which is not throwaway, but, like, it was very clear. Like, now we need someplace to put these. And so, like, we got there probably not as fast as, like.

**Kate:** Definitely wasn't in August. And you could have pushed harder and we could have Kitain there faster.

**Kate:** Kind of a little bit to Helen's point. I think it was the. It was in the initiatives and stuff that, like, got us finally thinking in the same direction you were, which I think is, like, the goal of those things, right, Is so that you don't have to be in all the calls and you don't. Have to dictate what we should do because we have such clear objectives and initiatives.

**Kate:** So that's that. And then, like.

**Kate:** Yeah, the Craig thing. I'm still starting to figure him out as well, I think.

**Kate:** It's challenging because, yeah, time goes, certainly, but.

**Kate:** I kind of expect most days, like, oh, he's been working while I'm sleeping, so I'm gonna, like, see something when I wake up, and then I don't, and I'm like,

**Kate:** What's happening? Is it because he has too much else going on?

**Kate:** Is it he's not motivated. Is it he's building his house? I don't know.

**Kate:** And so I just, like, feel like a nag, and I'm like, hey, anything today? So that's kind of why I've been. I want it to your point. I want to, like, figure out what works well for him from a cadence perspective. And, like, I don't mean to, like. Yeah, just, like. I said this morning, I don't need to put all the eggs in his basket, but, like.

**Kate:** I. I don't feel like I can do a ton right at the moment without some visuals behind. I go back into lovable and stuff of my own, but, like.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** So here's. Here's what I would love from you.

**Adam:** I would love for you.

**Adam:** To, like, be the sensor, like, be the driver of this. Like, you own this pillar.

**Adam:** I think that it is like, it. It is literally core, right? Like, it is the foundation of our products.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And so much depends on that.

**Adam:** And I would love for you to like.

**Adam:** Be the, like, the pusher. And, like, what do we need to do? Here's the plan. Here are the milestones, like, dates, deliverables, project plan. What's in and what's out. Here's the priority. Like, I think it's. I. I don't even really know exactly what, what. All of those things are, but, like, I do think that, like.

**Adam:** I mean.

**Adam:** Here's like, all the stuff we could do. Here's what we are going to do. Here's when we're going to do each of these things by here's who needs to do what by when we can accelerate this. If we bring in more people for this thing, like figuring out like that. Plan is, I think.

**Adam:** Where I would feel.

**Adam:** I would feel a lot better knowing, like.

**Adam:** February 18th we are going to have X done or whatever.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** You know what I mean? And I, like, literally, like, you were, like.

**Kate:** Y.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** You said we were rehashing the message. Your conversation from yesterday.

**Adam:** But, like, even when you're. When you summarize the message from yesterday, I didn't know, like, where are we starting? You know? And, like, what? I don't. Didn't feel like I had a sense of, like, timeline, what and when.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Got it? Yep. Yeah.

**Adam:** From that. And. And so that's what I was trying to drive towards. And now I feel like I have a sense of what I'm. It's like, okay, well, maybe not when, but, like, by next Tuesday, we are going to have these kinds of designs, and every day between now and then, we'll. Try. Like that was a couple of things.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** That people would say, we're also going to try and, like, progress this preview thing, and that will help us answer that. Like, so those were, like, I would say what I'm trying to get towards.

**Kate:** Cool.

**Kate:** Yeah, that's helpful.

**Kate:** I.

**Kate:** Will definitely focus there.

**Adam:** Yeah. And I think that.

**Adam:** Then maybe as this relates and I can go over. By the way, like, what I'm going to be late for is just like brainstorming with True about what we're.

**Adam:** Going to. And it's his turn this week. Like what? He's going to write his newsletter.

**Adam:** About?

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** So.

**Adam:** That is what life will make me feel better.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** And what I think, like, where you can focus.

**Adam:** So then in terms of, like,

**Adam:** The Hannah and the Jericho stuff.

**Adam:** I feel like.

**Adam:** Let's start with Jericho. I feel like Jericho's stuff is.

**Adam:** Not super related.

**Adam:** It is like a totally different beast.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** I would love for you to be like.

**Adam:** Her go to person for, like, how do I get the resources that I need, answer the questions that I need answered?

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** I don't. I think for now, you can give her space, and I can give her the input and Sam can give her the input and, like, happy to include you.

**Adam:** The extent that you want visibility in, like, those meetings.

**Adam:** I like.

**Adam:** My sense is that it is not close enough that it makes sense for you to spend cycles in time trying to push and own those things.

**Kate:** Couldn't agree more. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's more being able to have enough visibility that I can support her in the ways that a manager should support her. But no, I do not any intentions of owning, like, product decisions, priorities, anything along those lines in her area.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And then on here, like.

**Adam:** I. One thing that she's been doing recently that I really appreciate is, like, adding strong perspective.

**Adam:** And like, I think she has.

**Adam:** Increasingly good intuition about what can move the needle for us.

**Adam:** And, like, how to prioritize and how to, like, effectively communicate and make the case for that.

**Adam:** I think that, like,

**Adam:** There's.

**Adam:** Some overlap, but not a ton between, like, that work and this core work.

**Adam:** I also think that there's, like, some transition because, like, some of that might be in your brain about, like, you've been thinking a lot about, like, check out offers and, like, what to prioritize and, like, how that's going.

**Adam:** My thinking is that.

**Adam:** For the first couple weeks.

**Adam:** You're included in that. But we let Hannah drive and own it, and you are there to, like, support her and, like.

**Adam:** Provide any additional context that you have.

**Adam:** Also, you have other contacts about, like, what you're prioritizing for. But I think my goal would be to give Canon the space also to just sort of, like, run, define her priorities and stuff like that, because I think she's doing a good job of that. And I think we're.

**Adam:** See, like the. The management.

**Adam:** Where you add value to her is around like.

**Adam:** You have worked in these triads before and you, like, I think, have a good sense of, like.

**Adam:** What is the developer's role?

**Adam:** Designers role? Like, how do you like.

**Adam:** Where does Hannah need to get out of the way? Where does Canada need to be, like, more open minded or being too prescriptive or whatever? And so that's where I think that, like, you can add a lot of value.

**Adam:** More so than in like, the. The like mechanics of like, what gets prioritized.

**Kate:** Agree.

**Kate:** D. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, similar to Jerry, I probably misused the word own. That's not what I meant.

**Kate:** I think I used that earlier. It's not at all my intention.

**Kate:** Like I was saying way earlier, like, I believe that the product, people who own the initiative, should have full autonomy and responsibility over that roadmap of a prioritization.

**Kate:** And I have so much learned from Hannah, from, like, intuition. It. It's been an interesting adjustment for me, frankly, to go from, like, custom I.O. where I was kind of the Hannah, like, started there as an engineer, moved over to product, was there so long, I felt like I could just, like, answer stuff and be like, we should do this, we should do that. And, like, here, I'm still building that. Let that muscle. I feel like the operational side. I have, like, some experience that's been fun to, like, inject here, but. But, yeah, I mean, like, I trust her intuition higher than. Than anyone else.

**Kate:** 's, which is fantastic and highly valuable, being a product manager like she is.

**Kate:** So, yeah, I want to take in all of the context and information that she has and help guide.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Y.

**Kate:** And learn. But, like, her intuition is going to be far, far stronger than mine in that area.

**Adam:** Eah.

**Adam:** Which, by the way,

**Adam:** Goes back to, like. And this just takes time. I think that, like, you're still building that intuition and.

**Adam:** If I feel like. If you feel like I am injecting myself too much, like my. Guess maybe you don't already, but if in two weeks from now you feel like I am injecting myself too much in your work.

**Adam:** Like.

**Adam:** Where I'm probably coming from is that I am just trying to, like, augment your intuition with my own and.

**Adam:** And I have, like, I think I.

**Adam:** Both good intuition. I think you can also give yourself more credit. Usually, sometimes downplay, you're like, oh, I'm not an engineer. I think you. You can give yourself more credit. But, like, I have. I think I have reasonably good intuition of, like, what's possible, how hard it is, and, like, what is high. Value. And, like, so it's like, what is high value, low effort? I think I have, like, generally good intuition for that. And that's, like, what I was trying to get to this this morning.

**Kate:** Exactly.

**Adam:** I also like you are getting there.

**Adam:** But I also think, yeah, that's where it's like, if you were like, hey, here's a plan. Here's all the things we could do, and here's what I think is in and out. And by when I'd be like, what about this thing? I think that's high value. Low effort. Like, why is that not in it? You know, like, and that's where, like, then you and I can go back and forth very practically and, like, I can feel good. Like, okay, Kate and I are now on the same page about, like, what is the high value, low effort? What are we prioritizing in? January and February and March and.

**Kate:** Perfect.

**Adam:** I don't want to, like, put.

**Adam:** I don't know if it's like that helpful, but to the extent that it's not a burden,

**Adam:** I would like be very. I think that would be.

**Adam:** Bullish on the idea of you coming into Denver, like, one day a week.

**Adam:** And, like, we can even find a day that's, like, for me, Mondays are my lowest meeting days. And if you said, hey, Wednesdays are better for me because of whatever, the girls have soccer or some, like, I can move things around.

**Adam:** But I do think, like,

**Adam:** You, me, Hannah, even, like, if you said an hour with me, an hour with Hannah. We had together, we had some kind of question. Whatever. I think that, like.

**Adam:** That would be helpful.

**Kate:** For sure. I was thinking about that as well.

**Kate:** Kind of almost New Year's resolution. Like, I'm. Like, I should get down there more often, especially again now, like, with adjusted.

**Kate:** Responsibilities and whatnot.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** More than anything.

**Adam:** You don't have to decide it right now.

**Kate:** Yeah, totally. I just have to look at my schedule. Like, I know for a fact that it would be a fairly small window, especially compared to y'alls, like, in the middle of the day, so. Because I have to get them to school and then get back in time to pick them up from school, so that's my biggest, like, constraint from a time perspective. Other than that, I can totally make it work. And unfortunately, Evan's job, like, they started making him go in on Mondays also, or else Mondays would have been, like, ideal because then I could have used him for pickup. But I don't have that freedom anymore. Now he's only home on Fridays, and I know Friday's in the office.

**Kate:** Or not.

**Kate:** Very populated.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** But I can.

**Kate:** Yeah, Mondays.

**Adam:** I mean, like, also let me look at, like, a typical week for me because, like,

**Kate:** Y.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** What time is to pick up for you is like 3:30.

**Kate:** Yeah. I mean, well, 340. Yeah. 3:45.

**Adam:** What? What? Tend to get to leave here, like, three.

**Kate:** I have to kind of play with it.

**Kate:** To be extra sure on traffic, but, like, barring traffic problems. Yeah. 2:45 or 3. Yeah.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Call 245.

**Adam:** Because, like,

**Adam:** Even if you were here, like, let's say you left from drop off and you were here like 9:30 to 3.

**Kate:** Yeah, it could be nine to three because I. I mean, I dropped them off earlier than eight.

**Adam:** Yeah, it's just like, at 8, I feel like that's, like, peak traffic.

**Kate:** That's true.

**Adam:** And you live, like, two minutes from there, so it almost might be worth, like, waiting until after traffic. I don't get into the office until, like, 9:15 anyway.

**Kate:** Yeah. If we called it 9:30 to 3, yeah.

**Adam:** Yeah, but, like.

**Kate:** Book.

**Kate:** Of the day.

**Adam:** I think by 9 or 9:30 traffic is a lot less.

**Kate:** Agree.

**Kate:** D. Yeah.

**Adam:** And we can even, like.

**Kate:** Working under that kind of time frame the day.

**Adam:** Right now my Mondays have two meetings. One of them is a growth product pillar and I'm inclined to.

**Adam:** Move that to a different day.

**Adam:** And that way, like, I will only have one meeting on Mondays.

**Adam:** And we can just use that time.

**Kate:** I have almost no meetings on Mondays as well.

**Kate:** Nothing standing. I like to put one on ones like on Tuesday.

**Kate:** Because Monday is just. Anyway. Yeah, I think that'd be good.

**Adam:** Anyway, if. If that's not ideal, though, like, I don't know, like, let's say one of the girls, you get a call from the school. It's like, I don't know if that makes you uncomfortable that neither of you are in Parker on Monday.

**Kate:** It's fine. I mean.

**Kate:** Yeah, we'll see how it goes, But I think that that is fine. We can make it work. And if things come up, they come up. There's nothing you can do about that.

**Adam:** Yeah, yeah, obviously. Like, I'm not going to be like, oh, you're in the office. You can't leave.

**Adam:** It would just be maybe like a 35, 35, 40 minute lead time.

**Adam:** To get back.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** But hopefully it should be pretty easy.

**Adam:** I mean, like, yeah, like 9:15, 9:30. I would think that most of the traffic has subsided.

**Kate:** Eah, I don't think that's.

**Kate:** Bad.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And like.

**Adam:** You take 25 to the 20th street exit, and it's like we're three minutes off the exit, so it's like.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Can make.

**Adam:** Hopefully. Hopefully a breeze.

**Kate:** That.

**Kate:** Yep. I can totally make that work.

**Kate:** No problem.

**Adam:** Many other thing we could do, too.

**Adam:** I don't know, like.

**Adam:** This wouldn't work for Han, but I was going to say, like, I don't know if there was, like, a wework.

**Adam:** In, like, Denver Tech center or something.

**Kate:** Oh, no, no, no.

**Adam:** That could, like, meet you there.

**Kate:** It's really not a big deal. I'd rather go to the office.

**Kate:** Than.

**Adam:** Y.

**Adam:** Eah, okay.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Co.

**Kate:** Ol?

**Adam:** All.

**Adam:** Right? I like this.

**Adam:** Plan.

**Adam:** Anything else.

**Adam:** What did we not cover?

**Kate:** No, I think we covered a ton. I know we're already over time, so thank you. I'm sure I'll have follow up thoughts as I process more and whatnot. But yeah, in general, I appreciate the transparency.

**Kate:** Makes sense. Good back.

**Adam:** That.

**Kate:** And we'll get a good cadence going.

**Adam:** I'll send you. I don't know if I've ever sent you this recording.

**Adam:** Did I ever send you the recording of like my installed visually?

**Kate:** Yes.

**Adam:** On cams like Monarch website.

**Kate:** Yep, I have.

**Kate:** It.

**Adam:** Okay?

**Adam:** So you have that.

**Adam:** That was July 9th.

**Adam:** So just giving you a sense of, like.

**Kate:** Yeah, okay.

**Kate:** I mean, I do. I. I saw that.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** So. So that was like. Just to get, like, that.

**Adam:** 's basically, it was like, around then, I was like,

**Adam:** We should do this.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** And again, it kind of goes back to, how does that happen? How do priorities, like, get clearly.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Totally.

**Kate:** Communicated and.

**Adam:** I'm not. No fault Like I am responsible for the circumstances, but like, that's if you sense my.

**Adam:** Bump to get this done. That's where it's coming from.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** I.

**Kate:** Got it.

**Kate:** Cool.

**Adam:** Cool.

**Kate:** All right.

**Adam:** All right, we'll talk about.

**Kate:** See ya.
