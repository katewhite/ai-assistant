## Transcript

**Other attendee:** Happy new year, y'all.

**Other attendee:** Mike, I saw you just reacted. I was telling people at our Christos dinner about your marin performance. That was incredible.

**Other attendee:** Oh.

**Other attendee:** Thank you.

**Other attendee:** It was someone who.

**Other attendee:** She's worked with the Santa Fe Opera. And I was like. And she was talking about instruments, and I was like, we just saw an incredible performance. Almost worked there. I know. That's what I told her.

**Other attendee:** Cool.

**Other attendee:** Sound working.

**Other attendee:** Okay. Doorbells. Okay, good.

**Other attendee:** Anyone have any highlights from the break?

**Other attendee:** You got to meet both. All right, now we're unmuted.

**Other attendee:** Can you guys hear us?

**Other attendee:** Yeah, you're good. You're good.

**Other attendee:** Excellent.

**Other attendee:** I mean, my highlight is nobody in my family got sick. Everyone is sick right now.

**Other attendee:** So that was good.

**Other attendee:** That's a huge highlight.

**Other attendee:** It is a huge highlight.

**Other attendee:** Knock on wood.

**Other attendee:** I didn't share the same success.

**Other attendee:** As you can.

**Other attendee:** Nice.

**Other attendee:** Yeah.

**Other attendee:** No.

**Other attendee:** I didn't tell if it's us or probably us.

**Other attendee:** No, I think it was Kim's audio.

**Other attendee:** Oh, is.

**Other attendee:** It me?

**Other attendee:** We can hear you now. That sentence just cut out.

**Other attendee:** But. Yeah, kim. No, we all got sick.

**Other attendee:** Well, actually, everyone but me.

**Other attendee:** I was unscathed, but there was some sort of cough.

**Other attendee:** Some sort of cold.

**Other attendee:** People of the Internet are calling it the Bubonic Lady.

**Other attendee:** This is why I didn't leave my house.

**Other attendee:** I'm not a person of the Internet, I guess.

**Other attendee:** Cool. Well, welcome back, everyone.

**Other attendee:** And happy 2026.

**Other attendee:** And happy new year.

**Other attendee:** I hope everyone is feeling good and rested. Hopefully not still sick.

**Other attendee:** Really nice timing this year with the days off.

**Other attendee:** And I'm coming back super rested, Although we've been dealing with a baby sleep regression.

**Other attendee:** So, like, super rested within life constraints.

**Other attendee:** I'm gonna jump into it because we have a lot to go through.

**Other attendee:** I think as a bunch of you guys know. Well, actually, maybe first.

**Other attendee:** Quick intros. We have two people whose first day it is today.

**Other attendee:** So I want to welcome Alicia. And, Alicia, maybe you can unmute and say hi.

**Other attendee:** Where you're at, your role and your favorite thing to cook.

**Other attendee:** Oh, gosh, that's a great question. Well, hi, everyone. My name is Alicia Yule. I'm joining today as customer Success Manager. Super stoked to be here.

**Other attendee:** And I'm based in Dallas, Texas. Favorite thing to cook. Gosh.

**Other attendee:** I don't have a good answer to that because I've been wondering too much takeout. So I'm going to say my favorite thing to order right now is doll mockney. It's an Indian dish. It's a black lentil curry.

**Other attendee:** So go with that.

**Other attendee:** Great.

**Other attendee:** Awesome. And then also want to welcome Jaca.

**Other attendee:** Jacquel, pass it over to you. Same questions where your role is and favorite thing to cook.

**Other attendee:** Hello everyone. I am Jaca. I am joining the product team.

**Other attendee:** I'm based in Pennsylvania, and my favorite thing to cook is hobachi.

**Other attendee:** Hibachi.

**Other attendee:** Like hibachi. Do you have a griddle?

**Other attendee:** Nothing fancy. You can recreate the whole thing with your oven at home and frying pans.

**Other attendee:** Great. Do you do the onion trick?

**Other attendee:** No, but I do throw, like, splash water from a water bottle at AJ and have him try and drink it.

**Other attendee:** Awesome. Well, welcome both you guys.

**Other attendee:** What's cool for me, and I think for all of us as a company, have known both Jaca and Alicia for years now. I think we first met Jaca on some partnership stuff with LFR. Back in 2023 would be my hunch.

**Other attendee:** And ended up hiring her husband, A.J. first, and he completed the recruitment process. But we always loved working with her there. And Jerrica brings, like, a ton of kind of technical expertise.

**Other attendee:** But really solution oriented and getting at work for customers. And then Alicia is coming from because so we've been working very closely for the last three months, but I think probably first met.

**Other attendee:** More than a year ago with some partnership stuff between Intelligems and because very excited to have some more folks in the fold who know us. We know them. And welcome guys.

**Other attendee:** A lot more new hires coming in. Q1 probably.

**Other attendee:** So, anyway, back to the main agenda.

**Other attendee:** I think, as a lot of you guys know, we spent much of Q4 looking ahead to 2026, so there was kind of a process to redo our mission and vision.

**Other attendee:** We did a bunch of investment planning of where we wanted to invest going into 2026. We've been doing a bunch of planning around our goals for the year, with the goal of basically having this be our biggest year ever. So I am coming in with a ton of energy. I think Adam is as well, and we wanted to take a moment to kind of level set on what the goals are for this year.

**Other attendee:** How that ladders up. And one of our New Year's resolutions as founders, be a lot more consistent with tracking against our goals at the company level.

**Other attendee:** And so this is day one.

**Other attendee:** We did a little bit of this.

**Other attendee:** At the end of year thing, but just like.

**Other attendee:** Some, starting from what was a great year. And a reflection on that.

**Other attendee:** We doubled our revenue. We officially ended above 10 million, which is great and hopefully should stay now.

**Other attendee:** We added more than 30 people to the team, so more than double.

**Other attendee:** The size of this organization. We added more than a thousand new brands and grew our customer base by 70%. Tariffs, if you can believe it.

**Other attendee:** Were this year or last year. We're in 2025, and I think we really just made an impact for a lot of our customers and help them navigate a ton of stuff. We burned about $4 million, so that is a lot. But also we added 5 million plus in new revenue. So a number that we look at often as burn ratio. You spend money to make money. Are we making money on what we're spending? And so anything below a one burn ratio one means for every dollar I spent, we made a dollar in ARR and as a SaaS company. Great. That dollar should recur, especially with high retention. That's very good. And anything below one is best in class. So we continue to run very efficiently and I think deploy our capital in a way that lets us run faster.

**Other attendee:** This is kind of the understatement of the year, but significantly improved and expanded our product. I was going to try to make all of the improvements, and then I started writing, and it became like, 50 bullet points. But we really saw a product team, engineering team, a shitload of progress last year.

**Other attendee:** We also did it meaningfully improve retention. There were some headwinds in terms of tariff situation, had pros and also cons and that it hurt retention. But that's been a thing that we've continuous been pushing and we always talk about. And that's the one thorn in my side from last year is we didn't really make meaningful progress at the company level. I think there were lots of initiatives, and it's a hard number to pull apart.

**Other attendee:** But spoiler alert, that's going to be one of the number one focus for this coming year.

**Other attendee:** I am not looking at comment. So, Adam, if you can maybe man the comment section, that would be great. And flag anything that you think we should talk about.

**Other attendee:** And, yeah, we put this in the memo, but thank you to everyone for what was really an awesome year.

**Other attendee:** I think getting to 10 million is no joke. Supporting 2,300 customers is kind of insane. Like, if you think about.

**Other attendee:** Let's say that we have two people logging in per store, 5,000 users that we are dealing with. That fills a college.

**Other attendee:** Sized arena of people that is a massive.

**Other attendee:** Effort. Building all this product is a huge effort. I think it was like we were kind of in sprint mode as soon as we got back from Mexico in April, all the way through Black Friday. And then a bunch of people were like, yeah, December was surprisingly busy. So I know it was a sprint.

**Other attendee:** Thank you guys for all the work that you've done, all the work that you continue to do, for doing it so gracefully, for treating our customers with love, for really just being dedicated. It's an incredible privilege to get to work with you all.

**Other attendee:** And Adam and I don't take that lightly.

**Other attendee:** The best part of this job is getting to assemble this team. So thanks for a great year.

**Other attendee:** Quick refresh as we go into the goals for next year. I won't spend a ton of time here because we've done it.

**Other attendee:** Recently. But our mission is we want to make commerce Intelligems

**Other attendee:** And our vision is a world where every business continuously learns from each purchase.

**Other attendee:** Adapts to every customer and creates more value for buyers and sellers.

**Other attendee:** Not just testing. We're doing Intelligems commerce.

**Other attendee:** We're helping brands know instead of guests. We're helping them adapt quickly to change circumstances. We're helping them look at their site as a holistic conversion and profit generation machine.

**Other attendee:** So pricing, content, offers. How does that work together?

**Other attendee:** Intelligems commerce is continuous. This is one that we want to make more. It's not lumpy, it's not test stop, test stop. It is something that is a practice that our customers are doing always. And we want to make Intelligems commerce accessible. So we want this to be available not just to the away luggages. Of the world where they have a bunch of teams and devs.

**Other attendee:** We want the person who's a two person company who downloads the app to be able to access as much power and be as Intelligems as an away luggage.

**Other attendee:** Let's talk about our goal for 2026.

**Other attendee:** We're going to try to get to 36 million in revenue by the end of the year. In the memo, Adam and I provided a bit of context on why we're going so big this year.

**Other attendee:** Quick refresh.

**Other attendee:** We have a phenomenal team who is now up to speed, like doubling the team size. That is a lot of absorption and digestion and metabolism to all get on the same page, understand what we're doing.

**Other attendee:** We're now set. We're ready to go. We can add another 30 people. And now that's only a third of our team, so we should be able to continue growing and metabolize faster.

**Other attendee:** Second, I think.

**Other attendee:** It is changing in a way that produces a huge opportunity for us.

**Other attendee:** So AI is changing how software is built.

**Other attendee:** It's changing how ecommerce stores are run.

**Other attendee:** It is going to change how people shop pretty significantly in the next couple years.

**Other attendee:** We are in a perfect position to go capitalize on that.

**Other attendee:** We have, like $20 billion of historical transactions. We have had more than 5,000 of the biggest stores on Shopify interact with us at some point and use our software.

**Other attendee:** We have tentacles that extend into their site and let us control things on demand. We can suck in all of the analytics to make better decisions. We have a bunch of know how sitting on this team. We are like have been hanging around the net doing this testing thing, continuing to add value for customers.

**Other attendee:** A necessity for us to go push the limits. I don't know if you guys remember the evolution slide, but it's kind of like we are here at a B testing. We think that this is moving towards continuous optimization agenta commerce. This is the year where we kind of push the edges of that and also. Go big.

**Other attendee:** It's a time to shoot our shot.

**Other attendee:** We don't want to wait around and play it safe because.

**Other attendee:** If we're not taking action, we're going to miss out on this opportunity. We want to go big because I think that there's a pretty significant external capital opportunity. Like, people are excited to go fund this space, and so if we can show progress,

**Other attendee:** We can go big. We can show how we're going to be on the leading edge.

**Other attendee:** I think there's a very clear fundraising story for us to go get the privilege to get a chance to go bigger.

**Other attendee:** And I think it's like last year, we look and we kind of like, we've always hit our goals, right?

**Other attendee:** We've been steady.

**Other attendee:** Aggressively steady. We're going to 3x, we're going to 2x. And we've kept the ship on the train, on the rails, kept the ship in line. We want to be, like, a little bit more crazy this year.

**Other attendee:** Push ourselves.

**Other attendee:** And so this is a big, hairy, audacious goal. A bhag, as I forget what book it's from.

**Other attendee:** And this is the kind of company we want Intelligems to be. We want to set goals that are outrageous and audacious.

**Other attendee:** Because you can imagine two worlds, right? We could come out here and we could say, hey, our goal is to double again and we're going to get to 21 million in revenue.

**Other attendee:** And we probably would do that.

**Other attendee:** We've always done that. And we can figure out the plans and mark that up and track the slow, steady. We could also say, hey, we're going to go get 36 million, force ourselves to think, what would that take? Hey, we need to launch completely different service lines. We need to leverage AI in a drastically different way that we can charge more for.

**Other attendee:** And maybe we don't make it all the way. Maybe we end the year.

**Other attendee:** At 27, we only got to 70%, 60% of this goal.

**Other attendee:** But we're way ahead of that slow and steady 21 million dollar case. And we've pushed our thinking to think about what will scale, what will be really big.

**Other attendee:** And so that is like the ethos in how we're going to set these goals. When we talk through objectives and we talk through key results, we are being very ambitious here. We should own that. That is what I want us to think about. It doesn't mean it's a failure if we don't completely hit it.

**Other attendee:** But we need to be operating in a mode where this is the goal and this is what we want to hit, because I think this is very possible.

**Other attendee:** I'll talk a little bit about how this breaks down.

**Other attendee:** So on our core software business, we're targeting 27 million in ARR by the end of the year. So that is still very significant growth. That's a 2.7x. We also are very excited about the opportunity to get revenue by doing more for customers. So maybe that services revenue. Maybe this ends up being more agentic tooling, but we see so much demand from our customers of, hey, can you just do this for me? I don't have the person to do this. I'm going to Churn because I don't have someone on my team. Hey, do you guys have agency recommendations so I can go? Pay 15 grand a year for and they're 15 grand a month and they pay one test.

**Other attendee:** Let's own that. And we are the experts on this. Let's offer that service for customers and also charge accordingly. So that is like a big part of our revenue story for this year.

**Other attendee:** We mentioned some of these numbers in the memo, but you break down the assumptions and nothing is actually that crazy and getting here. So this is a bit of a complex slide, but this is quarterly for 2025 and then quarterly for 2026. So our ARR growth in software basically growing 30 to 25%. Per quarter. We've hit that amount before. We're staffing up our go to market team. Ambitiously, we have that engine turning.

**Other attendee:** Services we're layering on this would be at a 9 million dollar run rate by the end of the year.

**Other attendee:** And retention, where you have some pretty big improvement assumptions in here, but also not outrageous. Our gross retention. So this is what percent of customers are we retaining so that Max is 100?

**Other attendee:** Monthly. So the average per month right now it's, you know, last year we lost 11% of the customer spend each month. That's hard. That means that we're, like, recreating our revenue constantly.

**Other attendee:** We want that to be at 90.3 in Q1, we want that to be close to 92% in Q2, 93.3% in Q3, and end the year at 92.5. That's not a huge gain. This is worth millions of dollars for us in annual revenue. So we'll talk a little bit about how we're going to do that, but this is one of. One of the three biggest levers. Customer count, we are moving up by 2.7x, so.

**Other attendee:** We're moving up by 1.7, growing 170%. We've got the plan in place. We're growing our ecosystem. It's aggressive, but possible. And then our revenue per customer. So on the core software, going from 365 to 404. So that's about like a 9%, 10% improvement. We're going to be taking on a project to revamp our pricing, and we think there's a lot of opportunity there.

**Other attendee:** And then charging for this done for you servicey type thing. So no need to memorize these numbers, but just to break down a little bit of what's driving this assumption,

**Other attendee:** Yeah. And maybe just to like. Because I think you said it, Drew, but, like.

**Other attendee:** I think. I think the reason Drew shared all those numbers with you guys is because.

**Other attendee:** 36 is not just a number we pulled out of our ass of, like, hey, we want to more than double, but, like, quadruple seems too big. Like, I don't know, it was really, like, across a few different dimensions. Like, on retention, what do we think is, like, the upper edge of achievable? On Christos? What is the upper edge of achievable on mrr? Like per customer ACV growth? What is achievable? And we were just like, what do we think we can actually do across all of these things? And by the way, we're going to drive retention through these things. We're going to drive Christos acceleration for these other things. And so we basically both a little bit tops down, but largely bottoms up, like, built this, and it's like, wow. Like, if we can achieve this, this is banger. And so, I don't know. I think we're very excited about the fact that this is big, hairy, audacious, but also very achievable. And again, not to say that if we don't hit every single one of these things, we're a failure. And, you know, we have a lot of mechanisms in place to, like, you know, reinvest and invest more as we grow, so. I think that it's not like we need to hit this or we like, or we lose, but also, like,

**Other attendee:** Yeah. This is really, really exciting.

**Other attendee:** And I'm pumped for this.

**Other attendee:** Excited to get after it.

**Other attendee:** All right? Absolutely.

**Other attendee:** No good.

**Other attendee:** Let me reshare.

**Other attendee:** So we're going to be on this.

**Other attendee:** Theory of, hey, we want to be more rigorous about tracking to our goals.

**Other attendee:** How we're getting. You know, I think this year we used revenue frequently, and I think that was really powerful. And we'll continue to be vocal and share out. Hey, here's where we're tracking on our revenue goals.

**Other attendee:** We want to use a system called okrs.

**Other attendee:** Objectives and key results.

**Other attendee:** To manage the goal setting process top down this year and say, hey, here's our strategy.

**Other attendee:** Here's our objectives.

**Other attendee:** Let's track how we're pacing towards those and kind of.

**Other attendee:** React and work accordingly.

**Other attendee:** So there's a link to a great blog post on okrs in the memo. I'd suggest you read it if this is the first time you're ever hearing about what an OKR is.

**Other attendee:** The spark notes are.

**Other attendee:** The objective is like a qualitative goal. Hey, we are going to be the best software for X. The key results then are the numbers that support that objective. What are the numbers that we need to believe that we would need to see to know that we're achieving our objective. So it gets at our like, qualitative. Strategy while providing quantitative things that we can track.

**Other attendee:** Good OKRs are ambitious, you know? Like, I think 70% is about the right achievement level.

**Other attendee:** If we're achieving 100%, we have not been nearly ambitious enough. If we're achieving 50%, we either messed up on execution or we're a little too ambitious.

**Other attendee:** Needs to be measurable and verifiable.

**Other attendee:** It could be that the data point is, hey, we're logging something ourselves. It doesn't mean that everything needs to be a query from the database, but we are tracking it.

**Other attendee:** It needs to be time bound. Here's what we're trying to get by when and then transparent and align. So you know what I'm going to walk you guys through is company level objectives.

**Other attendee:** Many teams have their own sub objectives.

**Other attendee:** And keywords to that, but kind of those map upwards into the company level goals.

**Other attendee:** So all of us should feel like we are contributing towards some key results. And then each key result, we should be able to see how it impacts one of Intelligems overall objectives and transparent. We will report out on these and look at them as a team.

**Other attendee:** Also.

**Other attendee:** This slide was created in one sentence from Nano Banana that's now integrated into Google Slides, so I would recommend trying it out.

**Other attendee:** So our company objectives.

**Other attendee:** I'm going to pause, let people read.

**Other attendee:** These, and then we will dive into each separately.

**Other attendee:** Okay?

**Other attendee:** Objective number one, deliver outsized value that requires minimal effort from customers, much of which is delivered while they sleep.

**Other attendee:** Again. I think we spoke to this in the memo.

**Other attendee:** We do a great job of delivering value, but we can never take our eye off that ball. Like relentless focus on driving value for customers is what will take us to IPO and beyond.

**Other attendee:** That's the end. All be all. If we are not creating value for customers.

**Other attendee:** We cease to exist.

**Other attendee:** Or I mean, maybe have a long, slow down plane, but.

**Other attendee:** We shouldn't exist at that point.

**Other attendee:** Effort.

**Other attendee:** I think has been a missing piece for us a bit.

**Other attendee:** What can I say about effort?

**Other attendee:** Only like 30% of Shopify plus brands are doing any form of a B testing.

**Other attendee:** So we look at our competitors.

**Other attendee:** We think about where we can still share the biggest opportunity.

**Other attendee:** Is from getting people to do this who don't. And when I ask people who are not doing it, this is anecdotal.

**Other attendee:** Hey, why don't you test? Why don't you do profit optimization or CRO? It's like, well, I don't have time.

**Other attendee:** I don't have the person.

**Other attendee:** I don't have the resources. I don't know where to start.

**Other attendee:** All of that.

**Other attendee:** I think is related to effort. I think there are very few cases where if I went to that person and said,

**Other attendee:** Well, what if we just did it for you? What if it was done? You didn't need to touch a thing.

**Other attendee:** And you just got the extra value. Didn't pay, actually, unless you got extra value.

**Other attendee:** I think 90% would be like, yeah.

**Other attendee:** Why not 10% brand concerns or whatever.

**Other attendee:** The second thing about effort when we look at our churn reasons.

**Other attendee:** The number one option that people select is I had a short term use case.

**Other attendee:** I only needed to test one thing or whatever.

**Other attendee:** I think that full sentence is I had a short term use case.

**Other attendee:** Given the amount of effort it required to get this value right. Like, think about how much you need to do to use intelligence.

**Other attendee:** You have to download it.

**Other attendee:** You have to wait for an integration.

**Other attendee:** You have to go think of a test.

**Other attendee:** If you have a team, you have to go advocate for your team that this is what you want to test. I need to get their permission from the right people.

**Other attendee:** Perhaps you need to go through a developer to get that thing written.

**Other attendee:** You now build that test in Intelligems So maybe through JavaScript, maybe through the onsite editor, maybe through whatever.

**Other attendee:** You set that up. You then qa it.

**Other attendee:** You edit on desktop, you created on mobile.

**Other attendee:** You probably send that QA link to your boss or to your teammate, who then also needs to QA it and check the box you launch it.

**Other attendee:** You refresh 10 times in the first 90 minutes to make sure nothing's broken and that you didn't mess it up. And you have this fear that you broke something every time you're about to launch a test.

**Other attendee:** You're waiting. You're logging into intelligence. You're checking results. You're trying to understand statistical significance.

**Other attendee:** And when you can end things and you're reaching out to support about like, is my test done yet?

**Other attendee:** It's done. Okay. Now I have to prepare a PDF to go share these results with people. I have to go get approval from my boss to roll out the new version. That's.

**Other attendee:** Like not an unbeliev. Dramatize that a bit, but not an unbelievable use case.

**Other attendee:** So that's, like, one thing about effort. Hey, we can just make the core flow.

**Other attendee:** Much more effortless. And that's where done for you. That's where we see opportunities with agentic CRO being really valuable.

**Other attendee:** While you sleep.

**Other attendee:** Is a little different.

**Other attendee:** It also is a way to reduce effort.

**Other attendee:** But testing is an active motion, right? I need to come up with ideas, I need to put them out there, I need to test them, I need to verify them.

**Other attendee:** Nothing makes me sadder than someone using us to test an incart upsell or a post purchase upsell.

**Other attendee:** And they do all this work to set it up, and they go test it and they find that it works, and they pay us our $1,200 for the two months.

**Other attendee:** And then they go pay rebuy or some after sell.

**Other attendee:** $20,000 a year to go run that same offer over and over again.

**Other attendee:** Because what they found out was, hey, having an upsell. I'm just using this as an example at checkout.

**Other attendee:** Generates me 8 extra cents of profit per visitor, which means $10,000 of extra profit per month. Which means, of course, I'm willing to pay $1,200 a month for the capability to offer this.

**Other attendee:** That is a huge opportunity for us where, as we prove things work,

**Other attendee:** What can we just have set live for people?

**Other attendee:** That we are powering empowering in a smart way. By the way, we could make those upsells way more Intelligems because we have all the data underpinning. We can build the models that dynamically sort it per person, help you a b test it and hold back it to make sure you're getting value, that is, while you sleep value. This thing being powered by Intelligems on my site is making me this much money per month, so of course I'm going to pay them this much. And if I unplug intelligence, I'm going to lose money tomorrow.

**Other attendee:** I think this is something that we have heard a lot about from because. And we've talked about that acquisition where, hey, great. Yeah. A personalization that tailors the messaging for new versus returning customers.

**Other attendee:** Tailors the banner by Clavio Segment merchandises offers around the site.

**Kate:** Is that yours?

**Kate:** Are you done with.

**Kate:** Give it to me, please.

**Other attendee:** If we can prove that that works in the trial period and increases revenue per visitor by 4%, we will leave it on and not think about it. That is what we need to go for. So that's like, I guess I spoke to some of these.

**Kate:** 2:00.

**Kate:** And.

**Kate:** Three.

**Other attendee:** But it's about reducing effort, increasing value, and finding these types of values that get achieved while you sleep. You hear me call it like a leave behind. So, hey, we go in, we work with them, we give them these ideas, and then we leave something behind that just makes money.

**Other attendee:** Also Nano Banana, but. And probably copyright infringement. But we have a bunch of Peanuts animations for each objectives.

**Other attendee:** So you can be on your barn.

**Other attendee:** I think a couple mindset shifts again repeating from the memo.

**Other attendee:** I want everyone every day.

**Other attendee:** Did I do something about a while you sleep use case? Did I talk to a customer about something there? Do they have an idea about an always on use case and share it out to my team or into the feedback channel?

**Other attendee:** Is the feature I'm working on. How can I bend this or use this to support always on use cases? Have I talked to one of my colleagues about that today? This needs to be suffused.

**Other attendee:** In so much of what we do.

**Other attendee:** And I am not joking. Every day I want people to ask, hey.

**Other attendee:** How can I push this a little bit more?

**Other attendee:** Related. I'm going to skip to the third.

**Other attendee:** This is going to require us.

**Other attendee:** Putting a stake in the ground about what customers should do.

**Other attendee:** Hey, I think.

**Other attendee:** If we have a different shipping rate for new customers, that will probably make more money.

**Other attendee:** Let's go try it out.

**Other attendee:** I think we sometimes get a little bit academic and are like, well, we're providing the tools. You decide what to test.

**Other attendee:** We are giving you the data. We are allowing you to run the tests. And that's a comfortable spot, right? We have the tools to do everything. We can help people get to their solution.

**Other attendee:** And we never have to be wrong, right? We're just the arbiter of truth.

**Other attendee:** We're putting it out there. Hey, we're going to tell you what happens.

**Other attendee:** We need to bring a perspective to customers. I think you should do this. I am seeing this work with other customers. Are you open to testing it?

**Other attendee:** That's going to require being comfortable with being wrong because the test may not work.

**Other attendee:** And that's all right.

**Other attendee:** Okay. We have more ideas, and I think one of the things we want to do as a team is share these ideas so that when we see what works with customers, we can scale them out.

**Kate:** Interesting.

**Other attendee:** But I do think this.

**Other attendee:** Is like a mindset we don't quite realize. We have a lot of like, yeah, great.

**Other attendee:** Let's see what happens. And now it's like.

**Other attendee:** I want you. Especially if we're on a customer facing team and doing onboarding, even doing sales, doing success. Hey, let's try this because I want to make you more money.

**Other attendee:** I am accountable to your results than you getting mainstream Intelligems. And I think taking that mindset is going to push our creativity and how people can use to make more money. We're experts on how Intelligems works, how Intelligems is set up, how to make all these things happen. I want us to be experts on how to use Intelligems to make more money by the end of the year.

**Other attendee:** By the end of q1.

**Other attendee:** I think that knowledge exists, but we need to push it.

**Other attendee:** Objective 2 Build the Intelligems platform and ecosystem.

**Other attendee:** We're in the Shopify ecosystem and there's brands and there's other tech companies and there's agencies, and that has been massive for. There's a lot of marketing. We have a good reputation, agencies who speak well for us. Our partners do free marketing. It's kind of been the secret. Sauce.

**Other attendee:** And so this is about doubling down on that.

**Other attendee:** And actually embracing our role in the ecosystem and trying to build our own.

**Kate:** Go.

**Other attendee:** Ecosystem within it.

**Other attendee:** We use the word platform last year in our goals.

**Other attendee:** And at that time, we were thinking more of it as, hey, we want a broad platform. You should have all these features within Intelligems, do pricing, do shipping. You do experience, you can do offers. And we were thinking about breadth.

**Other attendee:** We're using platform in a slightly different way this year. And if you think about what we would call.

**Other attendee:** Platforms. Maybe meta on the ad side. HubSpot? Certainly. Shopify.

**Other attendee:** A common thing is that they all have the ability for partners to build into them.

**Other attendee:** There are tools available for people to make it their own and to customize and to push the edge.

**Other attendee:** And as we look at our most successful customers and also where some of our best product ideas have come from, it's been our power users hacking Intelligems like pushing the limits of our tech because it is modular and well built.

**Other attendee:** And finding cool things. We want to embrace that and have us be a platform that other people build onto, build with, build into.

**Other attendee:** And that goes with the ecosystem, where then it's like we also have people sharing best practices and talking about how to use it and educating each other so that we continue to expand this echo chamber, the eco chamber.

**Other attendee:** The reason we brought on Jaca, who is starting today, is like, think a lot more about our APIs and things like the MCP server and how we empower all these people who want to build more on top of us. We're going to be investing much more heavily in tech partnerships which we've always backburnered in favor of agency partnerships. We're going to try to do both really well this year.

**Other attendee:** Because we think that tech partners who build on us.

**Other attendee:** That will create more integrations for customers that can make it more retentive. It can open up new pipelines. It can give us lots of marketing.

**Other attendee:** And continuing to push. I think for those of you guys following, but Victor's been doing in the Go to Market channel.

**Other attendee:** Push the evangelization and education, and we want to create more experts out there.

**Other attendee:** So this will become our moat. In the age of AI, I think emote on any given feature isn't very valuable.

**Other attendee:** Even like price testing to some extent has been remote to date, or is part of a moat.

**Other attendee:** Shopify is probably going to release APIs in the next year or two. That will make that much easier.

**Other attendee:** Remote will be our expertise. The data that we have and how that feeds our intelligence.

**Other attendee:** And this ecosystem.

**Other attendee:** There are competitors to HubSpot out there.

**Other attendee:** We would not switch because we've built so much on top of that system, and it's really become integrated into our workflows.

**Other attendee:** So we're the hub, and then we are creating the tools for lots of people to go build things on top of this station and with us as the center of the ecosystem.

**Other attendee:** A couple mindset shifts. Agencies are customers. This was something that Sam laid out in her memo and I thought was just like something that was so powerful, the name explicitly.

**Other attendee:** There are partners, there are referrals, whatever. But agencies are customers, period. We build for them the same way we built for brands.

**Other attendee:** We treat them the same way that with different teams. At times we treat brands, but their customers, let's embrace that.

**Other attendee:** And give them the tools that we want or that they want.

**Other attendee:** I also want us to think about partners as part of our team.

**Other attendee:** This done for you thing.

**Other attendee:** We are going and trying to figure out how to leverage our partners to go fill that need.

**Other attendee:** They love Intelligems. They know how the tool works when we're seeking an answer. If we're seeking on pushing something or. Hey, I have this idea. Can we test it?

**Other attendee:** Let's use our partners in that.

**Other attendee:** They all want to work with us more.

**Other attendee:** And so it's up to us to kind of pull them in to work where relevant.

**Other attendee:** And then as we're building, I think just thinking in terms of externalization and APIs. Hey,

**Other attendee:** How can we make this feature hackable? How can we make this accessible? How could someone use this to build their own workflows? Kind of the origin of AWS was they created a mandate that every single team internally needed to talk to each other strictly via API.

**Other attendee:** And that then created a bunch of good habits and structures where then they were able to make all that external.

**Other attendee:** I don't think we're trying to be AWS per se, but that kind of mindset of how we continue to build in the way that's modular, that's externalizable, is really powerful.

**Other attendee:** And then we kind of put that in the hands of people who want to build tools on top of it and push.

**Other attendee:** Objective 3 scalar revenue efficiently, predictably and aggressively.

**Other attendee:** Big growth goals this year.

**Other attendee:** We're operating with a lot of efficiency right now.

**Other attendee:** We are open to being a little bit less efficient.

**Other attendee:** In order to scale faster, we have a lot of headroom on our efficiency, like right now.

**Other attendee:** What I'm always thinking about is what's the enterprise value? What's appealing to investors? What's appealing to. As we keep growing, and it's like as we enter this year, we can twist those knobs a bit and be like, hey, we're a little.

**Other attendee:** Bit more tolerant on efficiency because we want to keep that growth rate up.

**Other attendee:** Efficiency is still core to our DNA.

**Other attendee:** We're analytical.

**Other attendee:** We are not wasteful or very deliberate.

**Other attendee:** So this is about. Hey, let's still do that. But as soon as we see signs of what's working.

**Other attendee:** Let's go aggressively.

**Other attendee:** The other part of efficiency is let's make sure that our dollars stick around.

**Other attendee:** If we're spending 80 cents.

**Other attendee:** To.

**Other attendee:** Get a dollar of revenue.

**Other attendee:** Right now, our average lifetime is, like, about 12 months for a customer.

**Other attendee:** So, okay, we netted 20 cents on that.

**Other attendee:** Person.

**Other attendee:** Our goal should be that the lifetime value is like 36 months.

**Other attendee:** Let's get $3 out of that person.

**Other attendee:** Out of that customer.

**Other attendee:** Okay, $0.80 now, and we're making three on the back end. That's actually now really great.

**Other attendee:** What can we do with that? Well, with better retention patterns, we can actually invest more upfront. I'm down to pay $1.50 because we see that this person is going to make us three.

**Other attendee:** Obviously, these are like, fake numbers.

**Other attendee:** So I think we've often looked at go to market. Hey, we're spending to bring customers in and then we're working with the customers. But it's all the same value chain.

**Other attendee:** When we lose customers, when we have churn, we make ourselves less efficient on the go to market side and we make ourselves less powerful because we can spend less, we can grow less fast.

**Other attendee:** So that's the other side of efficiency here.

**Other attendee:** And, yeah, predictability. When you go look at series B, Series C investors,

**Other attendee:** They're wondering, hey, If I put $30 million into this business, what can they turn that into?

**Other attendee:** Can they reliably turn that into more recurring revenue that generates profit over time? And so that's the other piece of this. As we scale, can we keep showing. Yes, we can turn dollars in into dollars out.

**Other attendee:** Of the flow. Hey. As we put dollars in the top end.

**Other attendee:** How can we be more efficient in our acquisition of customers?

**Other attendee:** We face drag from the wrong targeting or not having the right product. When we onboard and activate people, how can we make that more efficient and reduce friction, reduce early churn as we then have people adopt and deliver value? Can we reduce leakage here by closing product gaps driving adoption? The more we can reduce that leakage reduce that drag across.

**Other attendee:** Our business model looks much better and more appealing.

**Other attendee:** But we are investing a lot here.

**Other attendee:** I think mindset shifts should say objective three.

**Other attendee:** We want to scale fast and vigorously. When something works like great, we're seeing good results. Boom.

**Other attendee:** Push it out.

**Other attendee:** To like. I think we all know this.

**Other attendee:** But I think we've come to accept some level of churn.

**Other attendee:** As normal.

**Other attendee:** In some level of, like, that wasn't a perfect interaction.

**Other attendee:** But it's okay.

**Other attendee:** That's acceptable.

**Other attendee:** That just isn't acceptable. Like our goal. Ambitious, big, hairy goals. Like zero turn. We won't hit that. But that needs to be the attitude. And when something goes wrong, we need to fight for the customers.

**Other attendee:** We need to fight to keep them, to win them back.

**Other attendee:** You guys have my permission if you want me to step in and email a customer. If we have to pay the customer to keep them, if we need to give them free months, escalate.

**Other attendee:** We should not accept any amount of churn.

**Other attendee:** We need to fight for that.

**Other attendee:** And like that is going to be a shift.

**Other attendee:** But is so important to how we operate this year.

**Other attendee:** I'm going to come back to that.

**Other attendee:** Objective4.

**Other attendee:** Same as last year. Hire great people, build systems at scale.

**Other attendee:** We are at a huge amount of scale. Already 2,300 2500 customers is no joke.

**Other attendee:** We need to think in terms of scale. Because if we hit this plan, then we're at 100 million in two years. And you think 10 million is fucking crazy?

**Other attendee:** Imagine how complicated it is then.

**Other attendee:** So when possible. And AI makes this a lot easier.

**Other attendee:** Try to build scalable systems, try to automate, Try to make your life in six months easier today.

**Other attendee:** By thinking about, can I scale this? Can I make this automated?

**Other attendee:** And then hire great people and build great people. We have an awesome team.

**Other attendee:** We try to keep raising the bar.

**Other attendee:** We have a lot of hiring that we're going to need to do.

**Other attendee:** So we'll be improving our recruiting process.

**Other attendee:** Sticking to this OKR plan is how we're going to do this.

**Other attendee:** As in the terms of systems at scale.

**Other attendee:** And I'd encourage you.

**Other attendee:** There's no big mindset shift here except for.

**Other attendee:** Go. Think of the three smartest people you've ever worked with.

**Other attendee:** And just send their profiles to like your boss because we should go probably higher them or try to hire them.

**Other attendee:** We're going to have a bunch of roles open.

**Other attendee:** Go. Think of who you would be thrilled to work with, and let's try to get them on the team.

**Other attendee:** This is going to be the key result.

**Other attendee:** That you hear most frequently.

**Other attendee:** 90% gross retention in the first 90 days.

**Other attendee:** The early life cycle is so important.

**Other attendee:** For customers. It is when they establish trust with a product.

**Other attendee:** When they see what types of value they are going to get, when they integrate it into their workflows, when they tell their friends about it. Oh my God. I found this amazing new tool.

**Kate:** You also have to shower.

**Kate:** Leave.

**Kate:** It out.

**Kate:** The heck?

**Other attendee:** It is also our worst.

**Other attendee:** Retention moment.

**Other attendee:** If you look at all of our turn, more than half of it.

**Other attendee:** Happens in the first 90 days after install.

**Other attendee:** And there's integrations.

**Other attendee:** Some reasons, in some cases. Why? Hey, it didn't quite work. Let's shake hands and make go apart.

**Other attendee:** But there is so much opportunity to improve this. When you look through the HubSpot record of customers, there's so much back and forth, we make it difficult. The product doesn't quite meet them exactly where they want or what they expected. This is going to be our all hands on deck.

**Other attendee:** Key result.

**Other attendee:** Can we move up our first 90 day gross retention to 90%?

**Other attendee:** Because after the first quarter, our debt retention looks pretty good. Like for the people who stick around today, 90.

**Other attendee:** The performance is right where we actually better than we want it to be for the company at large. So if.

**Other attendee:** We can take this first. 90 day there's a cliff down. If we can bend that, get fewer people to drop off.

**Other attendee:** Make it more efficient.

**Other attendee:** Get less people who are in a fit in there in the first place.

**Other attendee:** That is incredibly powerful.

**Other attendee:** What's also great is this is controllable.

**Other attendee:** Right. We look at net retention across 2,500 customers.

**Other attendee:** Like, I don't know. There's economic factors, there's people coming in, there's upsells, there's downsells. It's very hard for any of us to feel accountability over that number.

**Other attendee:** And it's also hard to show progress because it takes a long time to have numbers flow down to net retention across the entire customer base.

**Other attendee:** Customers who start today. That is our cohort for this.

**Other attendee:** Customers who start next week. That is our cohort. We will track these people rigorously.

**Other attendee:** We have control over this, we are going to debrief every single time something doesn't hit this goal.

**Other attendee:** And we are going to make progress. If it is, like, the only thing we do this quarter, this is what we're going to do.

**Other attendee:** And if we do this,

**Other attendee:** All of our wireless dreams come true.

**Other attendee:** I can go take this. We can fundraise whatever we want. We can fund whatever product development we want. This is the missing link.

**Other attendee:** In our story externally.

**Other attendee:** We will talk about this a lot.

**Other attendee:** If you remember one thing from today.

**Other attendee:** 90% first 90 day gross retention.

**Other attendee:** How can you help that?

**Other attendee:** Your manager probably has ideas. If you have ideas, please share them.

**Other attendee:** I know we got 10 minutes left.

**Other attendee:** So we've already talked about some mindset shifts.

**Other attendee:** Just a couple maybe mantras going into the year.

**Other attendee:** I think we do this with a bias towards creative action.

**Other attendee:** We'd like to think, we like to plan.

**Other attendee:** We like to have really strong plans.

**Other attendee:** And that's good. And we should all keep getting feedback from each other.

**Other attendee:** When you are owning something, you need to be the driver and bring the bias to action. And that action should be creative.

**Other attendee:** It's easy to slip into reacting, oh, I'm just responding to customers. I'm doing this, I'm doing that.

**Other attendee:** No. How do we want this to look? Not. How do we want our customers want it to look? Not. How do we think this other department wants it to look? Not. How do I think Drew and Adam want to look like? We will give you feedback, but you drive the creation, and that's hard.

**Other attendee:** Because it requires risk. It requires risk that it's not going to be right.

**Other attendee:** So we can't let the perfect be the enemy. The good.

**Other attendee:** It's going to require being down to make mistakes, which is great.

**Kate:** We need help.

**Other attendee:** As long as we're learning from them.

**Other attendee:** And it's better to make mistakes quickly, right? And learn faster.

**Other attendee:** Than come up with a plan. And turns out we missed the mark, and we know lost three months.

**Other attendee:** And we need to be willing to make decisions and conflicting feedback. If you're owning something, you're going to get a lot of feedback. That's the kind of place this is. We value that more brains are better than one.

**Other attendee:** When it's your decision, you have to just be down and say, yeah, cool. Thank you. Here's what we're going to do.

**Other attendee:** And you have my permission to do that. Especially on decisions that are two way doors. Like, we can try it and then we can unmake it if we want.

**Kate:** El.

**Kate:** Sie.

**Other attendee:** I mean, there are so many quotes along these lines. Like, Adam and I started looking for them, and then we added a bunch. And then this Picasso one I saw last night, and I was like, oh, my God, this one's also a fit.

**Other attendee:** I do not want to understate how hard it is to create shit, to look at a blank page.

**Other attendee:** And be like, here's what I think we should do. It is intimidating, requires energy, but you just have to start write down 10 crazy ideas off the bat that are bad.

**Other attendee:** And then you'll get going. But we need to have that bias for trying to hit these goals this year. We need to be making significant progress.

**Kate:** All right, Keep working on your room.

**Other attendee:** By the end of January to put ourselves on this trajectory, it is going to feel different.

**Kate:** I.

**Kate:** Hope so.

**Other attendee:** I think we also need to be really open and curious.

**Other attendee:** This is our plan. This is our stake in the ground. This is Adam and I taking the blank page saying this is what we're going to do this year.

**Other attendee:** It may be completely wrong.

**Other attendee:** We may discover things, technology may change.

**Other attendee:** We may say, hey, this KR is unachievable and we should dedicate our focus somewhere else.

**Other attendee:** That is great and is only going to come if we are open and curious.

**Other attendee:** About how things are going.

**Other attendee:** Open about? Yeah, this isn't working. Cool. What should we do next? Open about what our customers want and listening to them.

**Other attendee:** Open to our teammates, open to revisiting past decisions.

**Other attendee:** So we're adding a six company value.

**Other attendee:** It's going to be curiosity. I think this is one that came up a lot at the off site Mexico last year. It was like our most voted upon value. I think it's one that people feel a lot and comes up a lot in just conversations.

**Other attendee:** And so I'm really excited that we're going to be officially adding this.

**Other attendee:** And you'll find it on our values page.

**Other attendee:** And then, like, you know, I think we do this well, but just.

**Other attendee:** We're all working together to fix friction and reach our ambition.

**Other attendee:** You know, I think everyone here.

**Other attendee:** Wants to win.

**Other attendee:** Wants to be exceptional and is trying to be our best.

**Other attendee:** No one wants to create friction. Full frictious experiences for customers.

**Other attendee:** And sometimes I think we, like, hold back from being like, oh, this seems not great. How can we fix it?

**Other attendee:** Oh, how did this happen? Because we want to be kind.

**Other attendee:** But, like, Kander and honesty is great, and, like, we're all on the same team trying to find this stuff, so none of us see the whole customer journey.

**Other attendee:** And if you see something, like, below the bar, just raise it. Ask, hey, like, is there anybody can help fix this? How this happen? Does anyone know the detail here? Those escalations are like gifts because that's oh, okay, cool. Here's what happened. This There's a leak in our pipe here. Let's go fix it with an sop.

**Other attendee:** But if we just kind of, like, accept it, or we don't want to hurt people's feelings or we do this, then, like, they don't get fixed. And this is really going to be a process, especially that gross retention goal, just like finding and fixing a thousand small little things.

**Other attendee:** Cool. We're almost there.

**Other attendee:** As we shift around goals. Like, a big part of the reason to do okrs is, hey, are we focusing on the most important things? Like, there's a lot of stuff that didn't make it into these okrs.

**Other attendee:** We shouldn't focus on those. Like you have permission to not focus on those.

**Other attendee:** We're going to focus on these high leverage things.

**Other attendee:** We've made, like, a lot of kind of org shifts.

**Other attendee:** Throughout the company over the last, like, two months. Basically, in the spirit of how do we allocate?

**Other attendee:** People.

**Other attendee:** Which is our most important and powerful resource.

**Other attendee:** Towards our most important objectives. And so I wanted to, like, talk about some org changes.

**Other attendee:** Thank everyone for the flexibility and kind of say, hey, like, more of these are probably going to be coming down the line as we continue to figure out what's most important. So on the product side,

**Other attendee:** We're entering the year with six product pillars.

**Other attendee:** So kind of like working groups that are, are pushing on these areas.

**Other attendee:** Core experience.

**Other attendee:** So kind of our core flows in Intelligems.

**Other attendee:** Profit levers. You also may hear this called surface areas. So like, what are the other places where we can.

**Other attendee:** Change customer stores checkouts, offers.

**Other attendee:** The cart potentially growth. How do we activate people? Engage them, get them to adopt, especially early in the life cycle.

**Other attendee:** Insights. So this is like sitewide analytics or analytics page. How do we do simulations? Like, how do we use data to generate insights for how people should use intelligence?

**Other attendee:** Ecosystem.

**Other attendee:** So how do we enable others to build on top of and with us?

**Other attendee:** And then agentic. How do we start using AI agents to kind of like, pull all the levers of Intelligems for you?

**Other attendee:** This is how we're, like, aligned against these. So kind of like product lead or engineering lead and our design lead for each of these areas in case you have questions or want to reach out, so.

**Other attendee:** A lot of stuff move in.

**Other attendee:** Some other organizational shifts Just so we're all on the same page. Andrew is leading a new initiative and soon to be team around agentic related. Milan is now leading the data science and data engineering team. So kind of like great, let's free up. Andrew, go focus totally immersed on a gentic gun for you. How do we use agents to deliver value for customers? And Millen is now working with Donald Julie to kind of keep driving our improvements on, you know, how we bring data to customers, have data science that feeds our product, have the data engineering that feeds the data to all the places that need to go.

**Other attendee:** Solutioning is now moving into Sarah's organization. AJ And Gustavo are the team there.

**Other attendee:** Previously solutioning lived in go to market.

**Other attendee:** Solutioning will still heavily support go to market in presales. The goal here is have it follow all the way through the customer lifecycle.

**Other attendee:** Onboarding is moving into the Success organization.

**Other attendee:** We're trying to reduce handoffs on the customer journey and think that, like, you know, if success can lead the onboarding and then take the relationship there forward, smoother process, go to market ops and revenue ops. So, Nate,

**Other attendee:** We are shifting over to the strategic finance org. That's going to free up some more focus for Sam as we lean more into partnerships and agencies. And we also think like create some nice feedback loops between strategic finance, which does a lot of our internal analytics, and the go to market orgs and then customer marketing. Shane moving on to the product growth squad under Emily. So thanks to everyone for the flexibility. Who's in one of these?

**Other attendee:** I think I'm pretty pumped about that. We have the right people focused on the right problems.

**Other attendee:** Changes of privilege. It means that we're, like, doing well, going after the right things. And so, yeah, this is kind of the norm at a startup.

**Other attendee:** In conclusion.

**Other attendee:** I want to talk about, like, what winning looks like. I think we need to embrace the fact that we are a team that wants to win. Like, we're all kind. We're all kind of low key. I think we solve for thoughtful people in recruiting. I think we also solve for people who are, like, really exceptional. I think we're all pretty competitive and, like, want to be great.

**Other attendee:** And so what does this look like for this year? If we want to be great and we want to hit win.

**Other attendee:** Achieving these objectives, that's like, name the game. If we do these, if we hit 70% of these,

**Other attendee:** Word.

**Other attendee:** In a fantastic place.

**Other attendee:** I think it means that we work together well, cross functionally in a way that holds each other accountable, is still supportive and kind in all the things that we value in our culture.

**Other attendee:** But also, like, pushes each other.

**Other attendee:** And makes each other better.

**Other attendee:** I think we're not settling. This came up in a couple spots, but, like, we're not taking a churn for granted. We're not letting something go by the wayside. We're not saying, oh, I guess this is normal, that this process is kind of, like, messed up and friction full, like, no.

**Other attendee:** Flag it.

**Other attendee:** We may not work on it, right? We may say, all right, that's one that we're like.

**Other attendee:** It's not. It's not the most important thing. We're going to let that fire burn.

**Other attendee:** But we shouldn't take for granted things.

**Other attendee:** Moving quickly. Already talked about this. And, yeah, I mean, I think, like, loving what we do and continuing to get joy from working with these customers.

**Other attendee:** Like I think we.

**Other attendee:** Get a lot of energy from our customers. And I think we have a lot of service minded people who, like, love seeing their customers win. So I want to make sure that we get that joy from the work and also get joy from working with each other. So, you know, I think, like, there's some stuff coming around. Like travel and how we get. I think our plan for this year is try to get many more small groups in person and have everyone kind of making sure that they're seeing people in person and probably do something whole company, like, probably later in the year.

**Other attendee:** So there's some guidance coming around that, but, like, I think just continuing to build these relationships and have fun with each other.

**Other attendee:** In what's like a pretty high achieving org, so.

**Other attendee:** That's what I got to say. This is our year. Like, I've. I've. We're five years in.

**Other attendee:** I've never been more excited about the opportunity in front of us. Like we've always talked about, hey, we're like. We're trying to hang around the net, you know, when the ball. When the rebound comes, we'll like.

**Other attendee:** Put it back or slam it in. That depends. On, like, soccer, hockey, basketball. We can mix our metaphors as much as we want, but, like, that ball's coming our way.

**Other attendee:** And we have an opportunity in front of us to go really get it and, like,

**Other attendee:** Increase the ambitions and the potential upside for Intelligems by 10x like this can be an IPO and beyond company.

**Other attendee:** If we are helping.

**Other attendee:** Websites that people use to buy stuff, make more money.

**Other attendee:** That is. That is a massive company, and there will be one built, and I believe it's going to be us. But it's going to take a lot of work, a lot of dedication, and I'm. I'm really stoked to get to go on that journey with you guys.

**Other attendee:** Cool. I left no time for questions, but feel free to leave comments in the memo.

**Other attendee:** We'll leave some time on on the all hands for questions.

**Other attendee:** We'll start tracking okrs. I'm hoping for next week. And. Yeah.

**Other attendee:** Let's go.
