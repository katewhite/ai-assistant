## Transcript

**Kate:** Yes.

**Kate:** I'm at the ring. Well, I'm watching Finley ice gate.

**Adam:** Is it, like, empty?

**Kate:** It's very empty, which she's loving. She's like, ooh, I don't have to go in a circle.

**Kate:** You go wherever you want.

**Adam:** Is she good?

**Adam:** Like competitive.

**Kate:** No, she just started. She's in, like, a learn to play hockey program. She's had, like, two sessions, but she's obsessed.

**Kate:** So a ton of playing hockey at this age is learning how to skate.

**Kate:** So we've been bringing her to the skating rink quite a bit.

**Kate:** To get her practicing her skating.

**Adam:** Oh, that's so fun.

**Kate:** It's new and different for me, which I like. She plays soccer, which is like what I did my entire life, so that.

**Kate:** Gets old. And, I mean, I'm glad she's playing.

**Kate:** But I like hockey because it's different.

**Adam:** You played college soccer, right?

**Adam:** What position were you?

**Kate:** I was everything from center back to attacking center mid, always in the middle of the field.

**Adam:** Know that there's a women's soccer team that's coming Denver?

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** I was thinking about getting season tickets just because I think it would be super fun. And, like, the new stadium is going to be, like, right down. Like, right not too far from where we live.

**Kate:** Is it? I didn't know where it was going to be. I think it'd be super fun.

**Adam:** Stop walking distance. But it's like ready distance. It's going to be like Santa Fe yards.

**Adam:** If you know where that is. It's kind of like, basically like we're I 25 South Broadway and Santa Fe kind of intersect.

**Kate:** All connect. Yeah. Cool. Okay.

**Adam:** And the train runs right through it. Right now, it's like, basically like.

**Adam:** Abandoned industrial site with, like, a lot of rail tracks. And, like, the idea would be that, like, train station would be right there. So it, like, supports public transit really well and, like.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Sweet.

**Adam:** It's right near the highway, so, like.

**Adam:** That's why it hasn't been developed, basically between, like, major roads.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** That'd be super cool. Yeah. I have been following, and I'll be honest, I've never been to a Rapids game.

**Kate:** But I would totally go to the women's games with the kids. I think that'd be really fun.

**Kate:** Excited.

**Adam:** See. I've seen markups of it. I don't know if it's on their website.

**Kate:** A handful of years, like maybe 2020 ish. 2021.

**Kate:** I was, like, venturing into starting my own thing.

**Kate:** And my co founder at the time. I put it in quotes because never really got off the ground. But I worked super closely with this woman named Marlene. She sits on a bunch of boards.

**Kate:** For various different companies. And anyway, she was helping me through all that, her daughter.

**Kate:** Just grad. Well, is about to graduate from Stanford. She just had her senior season. She won the Herman Trophy, which is like the Heisman of soccer.

**Kate:** All that to say? She just signed with Denver Summit to come play here.

**Kate:** And so I was like, hell, yeah. So I also was like, I definitely want to go watch some games.

**Adam:** Oh, cool.

**Kate:** And cheer her on.

**Kate:** So it's pretty neat.

**Kate:** And a good signing for the Denver team for sure.

**Kate:** It's very good.

**Adam:** I have to. I also know there's this woman who.

**Adam:** Was, like, super involved in bringing the team here, so she, like,

**Adam:** I. I guess she's probably, like, a minority owner, but, like, not because she's super wealthy, but because she, like, corralled all the people with money to, like, put the money into owning the team.

**Kate:** Sweet.

**Adam:** And she's like, she's an original text size person. So anyway, so I know her through like the tech network sheet was.

**Adam:** I, like, did a program.

**Adam:** That she ran. And so she has, like, advisor shares and intelligence and, like, I, like, know her pretty well.

**Adam:** And so she's very, very involved.

**Adam:** She would, like, put this program that she did, like, she would give us updates like,

**Adam:** Where they were in the selection process and whether or not Denver was going to get a team.

**Kate:** Cool.

**Adam:** And, like, all the drama between, like, the different owners.

**Adam:** And, like, all that kind of stuff. So I, like, kind of got a little bit of the behind the scenes stuff.

**Adam:** So I think I would reach out to her.

**Adam:** Just like.

**Adam:** Tickets.

**Adam:** But, yeah, I sent her a link with, like, info about the stadium.

**Kate:** Yeah, for sure. That's awesome.

**Adam:** 20-20-28.

**Kate:** Well, that's sooner than the Broncos, right?

**Kate:** Something like that.

**Kate:** Sweet.

**Kate:** Yeah, lots. But I'm trying to think of what exactly I might need from you.

**Kate:** I think.

**Kate:** Oh, just to continue, before it gets too stale, the conversation about reforge from Friday.

**Kate:** I went back to the sales guy.

**Kate:** And quizzed about the 30k for 5k instead of the 60 for 10.

**Kate:** We'll see what he comes back with.

**Kate:** And then as it relates to pylon and attention, and those being the only two things that we send in there.

**Kate:** I think in future we could certainly send more.

**Adam:** Yeah, of course.

**Kate:** Slack is one that stopping mind for me like anything in the feedback channel.

**Kate:** But the bigger thing is, even so, I did do a lot of exploration, especially on the pylon side, because when they came out with that feature request feature, I was like, okay.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** This is great.

**Kate:** The primary limitations I see with that or ran into with that.

**Kate:** Their AI chat is not great yet. So you do, like, the first three chats seem really good, and then it just starts unraveling, and then you don't trust what it's saying.

**Kate:** A lot of what you can do in Reforge with their chat is it'll create. It'll generate charts for you based on the feedback.

**Kate:** It will help you with volume and urgency and things along those lines. And then you can generate a data set from the AI that then creates what they call reports.

**Kate:** And it's basically like a live report. So based on the data set, it's constantly adding additional feedback that's coming in.

**Kate:** On that topic.

**Adam:** Interesting.

**Kate:** So you can see it. You can see the trends over time. You can see every feedback item in there, obviously, as it comes in. Pull real quotes.

**Kate:** Still chat with it. Just leveraging AI But I think the combination of the chat and the reports.

**Kate:** Is where the analysis side more comes in. And I use that term loosely because we're talking qualitative data. But I envision, I think I mentioned in the doc, this being kind of the qualitative version of our mix panel, like the sidekick to mix panel.

**Adam:** Like, it'd be cool. Like, I. Like, I don't know, like, this worked amazing.

**Adam:** You could imagine just being like, give me a sentiment. Like, what's the sentiment score of our product?

**Adam:** And just see how that changes over time and how that updated every.

**Adam:** Week.

**Kate:** For sure.

**Adam:** It's like 90.

**Adam:** Whatever.

**Kate:** Absolutely.

**Adam:** Algorithm is the same over time like you have consistent.

**Kate:** Yeah, you got it.

**Adam:** View.

**Kate:** Let's see. This was based on tags.

**Kate:** On site Editor in preview. So this is what the report looks like. And they call it a semantic label, meaning it's just going to. AI is going to use. It's just a theme.

**Kate:** And so it gives you kind of key points, whatever, but it keeps adding up, like what number of snippets. And then here's the sentiment that you're getting at.

**Kate:** But you could totally. It breaks it down into themes I think can get better over time as we add more context and tags and things like that.

**Kate:** Volume trends and then the exact quotes, again with the sentiment associated.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** So it's just like, more custom. It's tailored for exactly like this type of. Whereas pylon and attention alone are not really.

**Adam:** Y.

**Adam:** Eah, yeah.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Yeah, yeah.

**Kate:** So I think, yeah, that's kind of what I'm hoping the value for us.

**Adam:** I. I like.

**Adam:** I would say the only part of my skepticism.

**Adam:** At this point is just like, will we use it? Like, I wish that it was, like, I didn't have to pay for a year's worth of usage up front.

**Kate:** For sure.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Whereas, like.

**Adam:** I could see there's, like, two.

**Adam:** Versions where I see us.

**Adam:** Not using this as much as we hope one is like.

**Adam:** It doesn't work as well as we hope. And, like, similar to the pylon thing, it's like, hey, like, it's almost there, but I can't 100% trust it, and therefore, I just have stopped using it because it's like, my gut was as good.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** And I'm not saying that that's going to be the case, but I could see that being a situation.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** The other would be like. I could see this being the kind of thing where it's like,

**Adam:** If I'm a product manager and I end up like, if I'm a new product manager at Intelligems and I want to ramp context tremendously, quickly on a lot of things or on a thing, and go really deep and, like, get a ton of context really fast. And I can see all those snippets.

**Adam:** Like an amazing tool.

**Adam:** I wonder, like, again, not that this will happen, but could it be that, like, over time?

**Adam:** Like, this is a really good tool to go generate context. But if people are really focused on their areas and like their things,

**Adam:** Like they're really close to it.

**Adam:** Like you spend less time zooming up meeting like that context again.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Anyway.

**Adam:** But I'm not saying that either of those things will happen. I could see. I think there's like a I could see. I don't know if the chains are 5%, 10%, 20% that, like, we use this a lot for three months and then eight months from now are not using it that. Often.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Which is just like where I would prefer not an annual agreement.

**Kate:** Right.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** No, it makes perfect sense. I can say from experience at Customer IO, when we were using Cycle, which is like very similar.

**Kate:** Definitely solving the same problems.

**Kate:** That of any place I've ever worked is obviously where I had the most context and the most intuition product intuition, whatever.

**Kate:** Just from past experience and incredibly close to our customers, all the things.

**Kate:** Still, I found myself in cycle very regularly because you're informing and digging. Like you're digging deeper to find all the evidence that you might need to communicate.

**Adam:** All of them.

**Kate:** To others. So it's not necessarily that I didn't know the intuition or the context, but it was like communicating that to others.

**Kate:** Is, you know, 80% of our jobs as product managers, Right? And so being able to pull direct quotes, exact quotes, themes, again, volume of those themes you don't have, your intuition doesn't allow you to say like this has come up.

**Adam:** Yeah, and it's also.

**Kate:** 25 times in the past week. Right. So that's where I found the value in it on a very regular basis.

**Adam:** Yeah. It's also a muscle that I want us to use more. Like I appreciate how.

**Kate:** Agreed.

**Adam:** I think that we can attribute.

**Adam:** Our change in adherence to, like, mixpanel and metrics has been very largely driven by, like, your usage. And there's definitely a particular egg problem where it was, like,

**Adam:** Chicken, egg and farmer where it was like,

**Adam:** We needed to.

**Adam:** See the value and the data to, like, invest in, like.

**Adam:** Doing better.

**Adam:** Instrumentation. So, like, the instrumentation takes work.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** But like we often see the data, it might be leveraging the value to justify the investment in the instrumentation.

**Kate:** For sure.

**Adam:** And then also getting other people who, like, oh, and now, like, instrumentation exists so I can go to my thing and now, like, give more people. So anyway, there's like a three sided chicken and egg problem, and I feel like.

**Adam:** Got.

**Adam:** 10 the critical mass. It's like, great.

**Adam:** Maybe a really quick deck.

**Kate:** Really put back.

**Adam:** Check.

**Adam:** For you.

**Adam:** This made me think of something completely random.

**Adam:** I had asked everyone to.

**Adam:** Put together like a loom panel.

**Adam:** Link to a dashboard where, like, all their metrics can be found. So that way, like, my thinking was, how nice would it be if that's right, she was filled out for us every week, and we didn't have a reminder for ourselves that every Monday I had to go to, like, these three dashboards and like, pull all this data and someone, like, just like all that for us.

**Adam:** And like all our product ventures, for all of our product key results for updated automatically for us.

**Adam:** I had to.

**Adam:** Slip. Now that I'm glad we did all the work to, like, make it automated and, like, in a. In a report that you can just pull the number from.

**Adam:** Is it now? Like, now that it's all that's done?

**Adam:** Is it almost worth?

**Adam:** Having people go through that muscle just so, like, every Monday. Like, it reminds them, like, this metric that I committed to move isn't moving.

**Kate:** 100%.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** That was my comment when you were like, oh, those are the essays, or whatever the title was. Was gonna, like, go do that. And I was like, well, we still need, like, hopefully product managers will still be reporting on this and, like, our pillar updates.

**Kate:** That was the exact reasoning behind that is because we should be doing that.

**Kate:** Absolutely.

**Adam:** So maybe I'll just say drew. Never mind.

**Kate:** And putting a little blurb. So what automation are you talking about?

**Kate:** Or like, yeah.

**Adam:** So.

**Adam:** I think SA Sales Associate or sales Assistant is the title of all the people in the Philippines.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** And so I was going to ask someone. I think Mara was going to be the person.

**Adam:** I don't really know, Mara.

**Adam:** But, like, Mara was in it every Monday.

**Adam:** Go through all those.

**Adam:** Taboo dashboards and copy the number into the spreadsheet.

**Adam:** For us.

**Kate:** Yeah, okay.

**Adam:** So that way.

**Kate:** That's what you meant by automated was actual manual?

**Kate:** But okay.

**Adam:** That's what I mean by automated.

**Kate:** Because, I mean, technically, if we wanted to do that, it would probably be pretty quick to do that with AI as well.

**Kate:** But again, now that's happening behind the scenes and we're not getting visibility into it. And I think we have to, like, pulling three numbers every week is nothing. And it's something we as PMs. Yeah. And we should be able to speak to, like, oh, we think it went up because of this. We think it went down because of that.

**Adam:** Yeah, yeah.

**Adam:** It's just the context, but, yeah, I think.

**Kate:** We, you know, whatever. Like a quick, quick blurb.

**Adam:** Yeah, yeah.

**Adam:** Okay?

**Kate:** And again, whether that happens in the spreadsheet.

**Kate:** Like whether the forcing function is the spreadsheet or whether it's our weekly updates.

**Kate:** That part doesn't really matter.

**Adam:** I think.

**Adam:** Both.

**Adam:** I don't know.

**Kate:** Yeah, that's fair, too, if we have it.

**Kate:** Because, yeah, I guess we'll pull it on Friday to put in our updates.

**Adam:** Okay?

**Kate:** And then we can just dump it in the spreadsheet at the same time.

**Adam:** Cool. Han is upstairs doing a great job.

**Adam:** Leading this workshop.

**Kate:** Love it.

**Adam:** One like.

**Adam:** Just.

**Adam:** Conversation. I don't think it requires access to playing like a pattern that I'm seeing with Jerica.

**Adam:** Which I think is a totally fine thing.

**Adam:** Is this like?

**Adam:** In an effort to, like, prove herself in add value. It's like,

**Adam:** And it's a really good thing, but there's a balance, which is just like.

**Adam:** The balance of, like, having the perspective, which is the good thing that I always ask people to do with, like, also, like, this is your 11th day.

**Adam:** Like continue to be a sponge.

**Adam:** You know, like I imagine, you've seen that in different forms.

**Kate:** Yes.

**Adam:** And she can be.

**Adam:** Really? She says I'm in hot with like ideas, perspectives. Also just in the AJ.

**Adam:** There's, like, similar thing. I was like, dude, like, you're putting way too much into this, like, like, almost.

**Adam:** I don't know how to give him that feedback.

**Adam:** I mean, we should disentangle these two things.

**Adam:** But, like.

**Adam:** Let's talk about jerkin for a second.

**Adam:** And we'll come back to the safety.

**Adam:** But anyway.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** That's it.

**Adam:** I just wanted to slide that. I, like, gave her that.

**Adam:** We know you're smart.

**Adam:** And, like, you don't need to prove anything. Like, not just want to give you the permission to take a beat and, like, learn, but I, like, implore you to take a beat.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Kate:** I have delivered very much the same feedback. I've been framing it as like, hey, this is your onboarding bubble, and we need to protect it. Because she was like, I just feel like there's so much to do, and I want to dive in, but I also still have a lot to learn. And I said, no one is expecting you to be delivering on anything.

**Kate:** At all right now. You are brand new. You have again. I keep framing it as our onboarding bubble. Like, let's protect that.

**Kate:** Get as much context and knowledge around the product and the people on the team and who's going to support you and all of that as you possibly can before you're going to be expected to like. Deliverables right now are not a thing that anyone.

**Kate:** 's expecting, but you will.

**Kate:** Get.

**Kate:** You will. I don't think I use the word regret, but basically, like, when you get further along here and you do have those responsibilities and you don't have the foundational knowledge to, like.

**Kate:** Put the deliverables and responsibilities on top of it will be more challenging.

**Adam:** Okay?

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Can we switch gears to aj real quick?

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Well, yeah. I'm curious if you knew how to react.

**Adam:** Ion.

**Adam:** When my c shaped f5.

**Adam:** Curve is motion, Doc.

**Kate:** Just specifically about that work or the overall, like, I want to move into product. I'm going to do all these things.

**Adam:** Either.

**Kate:** I think.

**Kate:** I. I mean, I've shared with you before. I like people who solve problems and just want to build as product people. So I'm always going to be supportive of people who express that interest. I will also play devil's advocate and have a bit with him and been like, you know, like what? What's? Driving this? What's the motivation? What excites you about product? Almost interview like, I think. I think he has the right motivations in general, and I do think he has the potential to possess those skills.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** With.

**Kate:** Some more product level guidance.

**Kate:** In fact, a little template that he shared is one that I popped over to him. Like, just make sure you're adding the problem statements, the use cases and things like that.

**Kate:** So we understand.

**Kate:** Short stories. I think there's potential, but.

**Kate:** Maybe more curious where you and Sarah stand on it like a what gap is that gonna leave in solutioning be or his motives?

**Kate:** His motivations.

**Kate:** Are they?

**Kate:** Correct. Are they positive?

**Adam:** Yeah. I mean.

**Adam:** My.

**Adam:** My.

**Adam:** Guy is like, neither of them. I'm not less worried about either. Those things. There's, like.

**Adam:** Sound gossipy, but I don't mean it this way. I, like, try to find a constructive way to frame it. Like, that's, like, part of. Actually what I'm trying to get at is, like.

**Adam:** The wrong way.

**Adam:** And I'm trying to find the constructive way to say that.

**Adam:** But it's like.

**Adam:** It's, like, so over the top.

**Adam:** And like.

**Adam:** Actually. And I'm also wondering is that also is what's coming through here, a little bit of my bias to, like, the more informal.

**Adam:** Like, strong intuition, less process, less. You know what I mean? Like, I certainly know that I have that bias of, like, I value intuition. I don't value, like.

**Adam:** Templates and process and, like, and I push back on you, and you're like, here's the checklist. And I'm like, and so.

**Adam:** Is that. Is that what's happening for me, or is it, like.

**Adam:** Like, for example, if anybody contrasted.

**Adam:** And I'm not going to pull him to a product role, but we're going to, like, repurpose, probably.

**Adam:** He will have.

**Adam:** A new role.

**Adam:** Based.

**Adam:** Is like Seaver. I don't know if you interact with a sewer at all.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Has, like, fantastic product intuition. And, like, when he shares feedback and when he shares input, it's.

**Kate:** Yep.

**Adam:** Like, like, you know, he like, understands how it works and like actually like identifying a like painfuling or like a road bump.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** And, like, isn't trying to, like, just check a bunch of boxes or, like, impress someone. It's like, it's not performative in any way.

**Adam:** Anyway.

**Adam:** To me, it's like, okay, like, if agent had approached this in a similar way, it's like, hey, like.

**Adam:** Like a little less like.

**Adam:** I don't know.

**Adam:** Like it feels like there's a. There's a bit of a. That just, like, feels.

**Adam:** Like, I'm on, like, the receiving end of, like, a drum, you know, Like, I got tickets to something.

**Adam:** I don't know.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Kate:** So I think I'm hearing.

**Kate:** It's the way he's approaching it.

**Kate:** That's rubbing you the wrong way. As opposed to an evaluation on whether he.

**Kate:** 's yeah.

**Adam:** Capable or his intention. Yeah.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** I think it's also a little bit of.

**Adam:** Like, sometimes I think that, like, he misunderstands something and then, like, positioned that wrong, but, like, I'm actually putting that aside for now. Like, I don't know.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** But it's like, I don't know.

**Adam:** I worked with really good friend of mine.

**Adam:** I worked with a product manager.

**Adam:** Who would send, like,

**Adam:** The longest slide messages, like every slack message, was like an essay.

**Adam:** With, like, links to supporting information and documenting it was like,

**Adam:** Dude.

**Adam:** Like.

**Adam:** He's like, no one responds. It's like, well, no one's responding. It would take 45 minutes.

**Kate:** To read it all.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** To read it, let alone, like, another two hours to drill into all the things that you're asking people to throw into.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** That's why no one's responding.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** Like.

**Kate:** Eah, I think.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Yeah, I mean, I definitely.

**Kate:** There's kind of two topics here that I would love to dig in deeper with you. One is just.

**Kate:** The operational side of things, right? And, like, what product managers should and shouldn't be doing and how they should be communicating. And that's a big topic.

**Kate:** But to your point, you and I maybe have differing opinions there, so I definitely want to dive in there. And then there's obviously just the general AJ Thing.

**Kate:** I don't.

**Adam:** By the way. Hold on. And just to, like, address, I think that, like, your intuition, like.

**Adam:** I don't feel like that way from you at all. And I appreciate the areas that you were trying to create process, but also, like, the parts that you've been dragging, like this project, the core experience. Howard, I don't feel.

**Adam:** Like, I thought the video you created for the board deck was, like, perfect.

**Adam:** Like five minute video. Right? Like, I thought that the document on here's the problem and the why.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And, like, now we have that artifact for every time someone wants to touch this, they have more context about it. Like, I am seeing that, and I appreciate that. I don't think any of it was over the top.

**Kate:** Right.

**Adam:** This, by the way, is a huge project that we are going to invest as many, many people over the course of many, many months and.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** It's like I. I think that, like, where I got tripped up was like, it was almost the same level of effort or like a one day task.

**Kate:** A little thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's fidelity, which is what you were getting at in the, like. I kind of see that as, like, fidelity. I talked about it tons at customary. I was like, at what point and stage of a project?

**Kate:** Are you committing that level of detail and fidelity into what you're presenting, whether it's a prototype, whether it's a doc, whether it's a video?

**Kate:** Like early on. You're presenting a problem. You're presenting an idea.

**Kate:** Later, you're maybe getting. Maybe getting slightly more granular with what's expected and what the risks and mitigations and success criteria and all the things are. But that's only if, again, it's the size project that warrants that. And, yeah, so there's like a fidelity thing.

**Adam:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Kate:** Happening.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Kate:** No, that's really good feedback. I'm glad to hear that.

**Kate:** The levels that I've taken things is more in line with what you would expect. And that's kind of a goal because sometimes I even read some of Emily's stuff, and I'm a lot further away from what she's working on.

**Kate:** But I don't finish it because there's so much. I'm like, that's a massive notion document. And now I think it's better to start that way than just like, hey, we're doing this thing, and there's no reason why, and there's no explanation around what it's. Going to help.

**Kate:** But, yeah, there's a very.

**Kate:** Fine line between too much and.

**Adam:** And I thought.

**Adam:** I would almost. I. I agree. I.

**Adam:** What Emily did and, like, I think what saved her in my mind.

**Adam:** Was like she had, like, an executive summary at the top.

**Kate:** Yes, exactly.

**Adam:** And like.

**Adam:** What it didn't do.

**Adam:** Was like, she would have, like. It'd be like, observation or, like. Like key takeaway.

**Adam:** And I'd be like,

**Adam:** I'd be like,

**Adam:** That's surprising or different.

**Adam:** I now, like, not sure I buy all this, but then like, what I realized was like that one bullet point was like an entire section down below. And so like, I can double clicked, which I eventually realized is like my.

**Adam:** Contrasting intuition on a bullet point actually had, like, a whole section that I could, like, go get more context on if I wanted to. And so anyway,

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Interesting. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

**Adam:** Which again.

**Adam:** I don't feel, like, different. I don't know.

**Kate:** It's all part of what we're going to start trying to work together as a team to, like, it's, it's about, I do want to be abundantly clear that it's about, like, guardrails and guidance in these areas. And to clarify a lot of what you're talking about, like, to prevent the AJ situation, to prevent even what's looking like might be a Jericho situation. Like, to and then, like, there is a reverse side where it's like, Hannah's pushing back off into me and being like, I just know that I don't need to communicate the evidence and I'M like sometimes you do sometimes, like other people don't know that.

**Adam:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Kate:** And so anyway.

**Kate:** Yeah. It's about putting better guardrails in place on, like again. Fidelity, cadence.

**Kate:** When all of that is necessary, when it's not. That's just where we're starting the conversation. And it's certainly. You mentioned checklists before.

**Kate:** I effing hate a checklist. I hope I never said I like a checklist or want a checklist.

**Kate:** I do not.

**Kate:** I was forced to do that at customary for a hot minute and.

**Kate:** It made life miserable. I'm like I'm doing to do shit, and that's not what I like.

**Kate:** That is the last thing that we'll be trying to push for in this. In this case.

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** What are the next best things to do?

**Kate:** Within about aj and his work.

**Kate:** I'm happy to communicate feedback. I'm happy to guide him in better directions. He did mention to me this morning also that he applied for the billing.

**Kate:** That one. I raised my eyebrows. I was like,

**Adam:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Kate:** And again, playing devil's advocate, I was like,

**Kate:** Is it the billing side of that that appeals to you, or is this your way of getting into product?

**Kate:** Because I think the idea is that this person might be locked into billing. And he was like, oh, I didn't realize that. I thought this was, like, a temporary thing. And I'm like,

**Kate:** No.

**Kate:** So hopefully I made that clear enough to him.

**Adam:** I have a conversation with Sarah and Emily, like, a quick check in, in, like, an hour.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** On this topic.

**Kate:** I'm happy to help where I can. I'm also happy to kind of stay out of it.

**Adam:** It sounds like you're actually, like, in more touch with him than I realized.

**Kate:** Yeah, he's been reaching out to me a lot, maybe because of the Jericho connection, and just. I don't really know, actually, if I'm being honest or if he thinks it's core experience or if it's lead product manager and clothes, I have no idea. But he has been reaching out to me like he reached out to me immediately.

**Adam:** I.

**Adam:** Think.

**Adam:** Are you okay with it?

**Adam:** Or like, is it?

**Kate:** It's fine as long as.

**Kate:** It's clear what role I should or shouldn't be taking there. I'm happy to. Like I said, I'm happy to help in any way I can. But without additional context from, like, you or, like, even, this conversation is very enlightening to me because I was kind of going in blind before. Like how much of this you and Sarah were guiding versus him just kind of forging ahead with some stuff.

**Kate:** But if we think there's value in him.

**Kate:** Putting some time and effort into documenting these things. Like, I'm happy to help guide.

**Kate:** But I would just want to have a better understanding of.

**Kate:** What I'm guiding him on.

**Adam:** I. I just think Sarah asking if I should add you.

**Adam:** Don't even know if you're free in an hour.

**Kate:** I can.

**Adam:** I can just. But anyway.

**Adam:** It's not urgent if you're not free.

**Adam:** I don't even know if.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** Advice, input, feedback.

**Adam:** I think idle as well. I imagine it'll be the same. If it's different, I think it's also okay. I don't think that's, like, bad.

**Adam:** Or like a bad signal about us?

**Kate:** I might have. I mean.

**Adam:** I. I don't want to. Like, I guess for me to bar at this point, like, as long as he's still being effective in his role, not creating additional work for people.

**Adam:** Like, creating noise, like, actually, like.

**Adam:** Closing.

**Adam:** Something. I want to make sure that.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** There's other context.

**Adam:** Also.

**Adam:** The opposite conversation we have on Friday, so.

**Kate:** I don't even know what time it is. Are we over?

**Kate:** Yeah, I think so.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** We have.

**Adam:** Time.

**Kate:** What was your kind of vision for that work that he was doing? Like a quick hit list of things.

**Adam:** You didn't have the context going in.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Okay, so.

**Adam:** The context was Drew, Sarah and I, in one of our conversations.

**Adam:** I've been. I've been pulled into a few more these, like, solutioning, onboarding calls.

**Adam:** Lately.

**Adam:** Where, like, Gustavo and AJ Are, like, mostly Gustavo, actually, because, like, I think maybe I have a relationship with Gustavo and has been here for over two years.

**Adam:** And he dms me for things.

**Adam:** We'll be like, hey.

**Adam:** This is a solution that I've come up with, or this is like, how I've evaluated the response to this question.

**Adam:** Can you give me gut checks? Like, does this make sense to you, or am I missing something?

**Adam:** And as I'm, like, watching them and reading, like, the context of, like, some of the questions that were, like, the, the hiccups that we're hacking.

**Adam:** It's like, wow.

**Adam:** You know, like.

**Adam:** The answer you're providing is the right answer.

**Adam:** Based on the current state that our product is in.

**Adam:** Based on, like, what our current capabilities are.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** But actually, like.

**Adam:** I wonder if there's an opportunity to change our capabilities, to add a feature, to actually make this thing.

**Kate:** Easier.

**Adam:** Way easier.

**Adam:** And, like, I don't have enough contact to know if, like, this one question Crustall has is the kind of thing where if, like, I invested in making this one thing easier, would this one customer or help lots of customers?

**Kate:** Is it coming up a ton or is it. Yeah.

**Adam:** But, like.

**Adam:** I then had the real station. Like I me, Christian. Carolyn used to do all of the immigration.

**Adam:** Part of what being on shift was like in any given week.

**Adam:** Was also he did all the integrations.

**Kate:** Y.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** And in that period of time, we built a tremendous number of features. Like, something would come up on, like, doing integration and didn't work. We would just build a future, like, while we were doing the integration work. And that basically froze in time as soon as we outsourced all of the integrations.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And, like, if I. My reflection was like, wow.

**Adam:** I'm like helping you, Gustavo, with some of these solution questions.

**Adam:** We have made an update to our integrations and, like, the kinds of things that we are coming out of meaningfully and like two meters.

**Adam:** And I brought that up with Sarah and Drew. It's like, wow, that's like, an interesting thing. I wonder. And I don't have a product, like, capacity to be like, hey, someone spend time thinking about all these opportunities of, like,

**Adam:** This integration thing came up, and I think we could solve this and, like, actually create a better experience and, like, whatever integrations.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** For a number of people. So, like, the kind of thing.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** Well, that's interesting. AD has been, like, asking me about.

**Adam:** You know, flexing into more of a product role.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** Interesting.

**Adam:** Need, and this is, like, an interesting time.

**Adam:** Like overlap, which is.

**Adam:** I wonder if there's opportunities like. Like, I think that, by the way, like his suggestion.

**Adam:** If we can execute on something like that, like the interview has something that needs to do that. I thought it was not possible. If someone else is doing it, I'm sure that there's some team that we could do tremendously hard. And I can see it being a huge.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** Thing to do.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** That was going to be. My next question is, like, what you thought of the actual.

**Adam:** I actually wish. I actually wish I had, like, 10% of the context because, like, I didn't need all the context of, like, all the different customers. I just, like, needed, like. The problem is it comes up a bunch.

**Adam:** Of a little bit. Predominantly. Often.

**Adam:** By the way, here's, like, two other people that do it.

**Adam:** And I'd rather have, like, a tenth of context.

**Adam:** For 10 things and we can have a conversation about it as opposed to, like,

**Adam:** All this because, like, helpful for prioritization. Like, okay, well, I don't prioritize this company.

**Adam:** Trade.

**Kate:** Y.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** Anyway.

**Kate:** Well, and here's where, like my understanding of the exact solution job, too, is.

**Kate:** I don't know as much. And how deep.

**Kate:** But, like.

**Kate:** Him being able to.

**Kate:** Come up with even solution ideas. Well, I mean, I guess as a solution or. He should be able to, but I'm just wondering if he. If we're doing him a disservice.

**Kate:** Like, hey, go buy yourself.

**Kate:** To, like, tell us how we should improve price, like.

**Kate:** As a product person. I need a tech partner. I need a designer to help. Like, maybe not designer as much, but tech partner for sure.

**Kate:** Designer a little bit later, but.

**Kate:** I don't know, like.

**Kate:** Also want to make sure we're setting him up for success. Like, yes, I can guide and help, and I am understanding better the context of where this came from.

**Kate:** Thinking through myself on, like, how we could start to make better.

**Kate:** Not to go back to the first, but, like, even.

**Kate:** Reforge could potentially help with this, right? Like, hey, here's all the solution calls.

**Kate:** What are the problems coming up? How often are they coming up?

**Kate:** Which ones?

**Kate:** Showstoppers vs not like you can start to gain more context there start to.

**Kate:** But it does require someone dedicated to, like, think through.

**Kate:** The impact of solving those problems.

**Adam:** Yeah. And so that's, like, that was basically what.

**Adam:** That was the error that.

**Adam:** I.

**Adam:** In addition to all the work that you do, like, as things come up and you're like, hey, like, this comes up a lot. It came up again today.

**Adam:** Here's the opportunity.

**Adam:** Flag it. What's, like, added to a log maybe, like, once every couple weeks, we can go through it and be like, hey, like, is there anything we can, like, fit into a development cycle or two?

**Adam:** At least you really prioritize.

**Adam:** That's what I would rather see from him.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Got it.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Kate:** Another top ball.

**Adam:** And then maybe there's species that are urgent, which is like, hey, I recognize customer that's going to.

**Adam:** $1,000 a month, but we're, like, really hung up on this one thing.

**Adam:** This has come up before. It's not just one customer.

**Adam:** But could fast.

**Kate:** Yep.

**Kate:** Yep.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** But that's how you used to do it.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** And, like, you know.

**Kate:** I'm following. So just more. Yeah. Being our eyes.

**Kate:** With good product perspective and intuition on the things that are going on there.

**Kate:** Similar to what s doing on the support side.

**Adam:** Exactly.

**Kate:** Okay. Yeah, I guess just keep me in the loop. On what? How I can be helpful in that situation.

**Kate:** Happy to help. And then I am kind of curious. Not for today, but, yeah, kind of curious what y'all are thinking with Sieber.

**Kate:** If anything.

**Kate:** You mentioned, like, a different role or something. I don't know how far along that is.

**Kate:** Okay?

**Adam:** He doesn't know yet, which is why.

**Kate:** Oh, that's fine. That's fine. Yep. No worries. I just. I have had conversations he's mentioned, like, oh, I want to go product. I'd love to do the Hannah path, like that type of thing. That's about all I know.

**Adam:** He would be, like, teaming up with Andrew.

**Kate:** Cool. Okay.

**Kate:** Nice.

**Kate:** For sure.

**Adam:** This.

**Adam:** Would be a cool opportunity.

**Kate:** And I. Yeah.

**Kate:** It'd be great to get some more product eyes on on that stuff anyway.

**Kate:** Cool.

**Adam:** Yeah, probably less so from a, like, product point of view. I think that, like, everything is product. More of, like,

**Adam:** Go to market.

**Adam:** But, like, you need a customer facing side. If it's like Operation.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** If I need to. Andrew, like technical co founder. I don't know. I could have talked to all the customers, but, like, you spent all the time talking all the customers. Like, when you get to build anything.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** It's kind of like.

**Kate:** Y.

**Adam:** Validating a thing.

**Adam:** I think that I need someone doesn't trust to, like, go take a call without him.

**Kate:** Eah.

**Adam:** Like feedback from the customer.

**Kate:** Cool. Okay, nice.

**Adam:** It is like, very much like. It's like.

**Kate:** Yeah.

**Adam:** Also like support go to market.

**Kate:** Nice. I like that.

**Kate:** Cool.

**Kate:** Yep. Thanks, adam. See ya.

**Adam:** All right, I'm going to run.

**Kate:** All right. See ya.
