<aside>
💡 Challenge yourself to write a clear and succinct narrative to explain the project. Keep it simple enough that anyone at the company could understand it. Format is less important than the narrative. Avoid defining the exact solution (that belongs in a requirements doc of some kind).

### OKR(s)

*List the KR(s) you believe solving this problem will drive.*

### Problem

*Describe the customer, business or infrastructural problem to solve. If not a customer problem, explain what impact not solving this might have on the customer. Avoid prescribing a solution.*

### Opportunity

*Describe our opportunity by solving this problem - what will happen if we're successful? Explain how this outcome directly attributes to your squad strategy and the broader business.*

### The Tweet

*Explain it to a customer in 240 characters or less. Keep is plain and simple. Avoid internal language and buzzwords.*

## Proposed Solution & Scope

*Outline the essential capabilities and characteristics needed to solve the problem and meet the goals. This should be high-level to give the reader an idea of the direction we’re heading, but a more in-depth requirements and scoping doc should be separate (and linked down in the Resources section)*

**Solution Overview:** *[Describe the solution approach. Explain the core user flow and key capabilities based on discovery learnings.]*

**Out of Scope:** *[Explicitly list what is not included in this iteration. If this is a large initiative, this section could instead be a “long-term vision” section that lists all the other capabilities we may include down the road]*

### Why now?

*What factors are informing why we may choose to do this now? How does it connect to our strategy and what OKRs does it support? If we don't do this now, what's the nightmare?*

### Metrics

*How will we know if this initiative has been successful? How will we know if this feature is a failure? Do we need counter-metrics to measure if we’re harming other areas of the business?*

### Resources

*Links to any relevant project documents. This turns this page into the full project hub for this feature. The requirements template, for example, or Figma links belong here.*
