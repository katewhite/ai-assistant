# Document Templates

This directory is for document templates used by the writing assistant.

## Purpose

Add document templates here that can be used as starting points for various types of product documents (requirements, proposals, strategy docs, vision docs, etc.).

## Usage

The writing assistant references knowledge files starting with "TEMPLATE" when helping create documents. Templates should be structured guides that help organize thinking and ensure all necessary sections are covered.

## Template Structure

Templates should:
- Provide clear section structure
- Include guidance on what belongs in each section
- Help organize thinking, not just fill blanks
- Be flexible enough to adapt to different document needs
