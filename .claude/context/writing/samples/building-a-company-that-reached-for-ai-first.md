# Building a company that reached for AI first

At our recent product strategy offsite in New York, as I listened to our discussions on integrating AI more deeply into our product roadmap (rather than just sprinkling it on top), I reflected on integrating AI more deeply within our company. And I realized the transformation we need to make is bigger than I have communicated to date. We need to be a team of people who reach for AI as a reflex to help us solve problems and do our work.

AI enhances what has always defined Customer.io: the idea that technology can create leverage for businesses striving to maintain, or at least approximate,Â  the personal relationships they have with their customers as they scale. What does a good relationship look like? You might imagine the proprietor of a small general store on the frontier many years ago, talking with a customer with whom they have a long history: welcoming them by their first name, asking them about their family, and wondering how the last item they bought worked out.

Thatâ€™s what Customer.io has tried to do for thousands of companies: create meaningful messages through demographic and behavioral data that makes the content, channel, and timing of their communications more relevant. This focus on using technology to scale personalized communications has taken us to greater heights than we even imagined was possible.

Today, AI offers a new form of technological leverage that promises to transform the way our business works.

## Our reaction should be to reach for AI first

While our existing systems could continue to help customers send messages, AI has emerged as an opportunity to dramatically improve the quality, relevance, and impact of our customerâ€™s communications. This isn't just an incremental or tangential changeâ€”it's a deep shift in how we can create and deliver value for our customers.

To stay true to our founding mission of helping businesses build meaningful customer relationships at scale, we need to learn how to wield new tools whose impact we are only beginning to understand.

As with all new tools, becoming proficient and productive will take time.Â  But for the sake of removing all ambiguity around expectations from this point forward:

1. **We must actively seek out AI-powered solutions to serve our customers better.**
2. **Every person in this company should be using AI as a lever to create more value.**

These expectations keep us competitive,Â  and help us meet the needs of prospects and customers today and tomorrow.

## We are already using AI effectively today

Our customers are already using AI to create more value faster in their own businesses, so it's natural for them to expect us to do the same, not only within our product, but also within our operations.

We're already seeing the benefits of integrating AI into various areas of our business. Goose, our AI support agent, and Conveyor, our Legal AI tool that automates security questionnaire and RFP responses, are examples I use because they demonstrate how we can support customers across multiple phases of their lifecycle with us. Rather than forcing us to choose between efficiency and quality, these solutions simultaneously improve our operational efficiency and upgrade the customerâ€™s experience because they free our teams to focus on the higher-value work that requires human creativity and judgment.

Elsewhere within the company, teams are learning how to harness AI for everything from writing code to content creation to data analysis to market research. Each success story underscores how AI can help us deliver more value with greater efficiency.

Along the way, I've been nudging our team to increase our AI usage over the past months through the #colin-thinks-u-should-use-ai-more (now #ai-wins) channel and by featuring your AI workflows that we can all learn from.

## How I expect us to use AI next

Iâ€™m changing my expectations on the use of AI internally. Rather than some people using AI some of the time, I want us to assume weâ€™re all reaching for AI first when weâ€™re solving any problem. To be specific, we will use:

**AI fluency in hiring**: Starting today, we will assess candidates for AI fluency as part of the hiring process. This means we will evaluate their actual demonstration of AI skills through practical assessmentsâ€”not just theoretical knowledge. For example, we may ask them to solve a problem using AI tools in real-time during interviews.

**AI in performance**: Going forward, AI use in your job will be evaluated during performance reviews. Your role might have code to write, assets to create, problems to solve, or customers to interact with where reaching for AI first can vastly outperform you without AI. This isnâ€™t limited to one part or level of the company; it extends from me to you and everyone in between.

**AI in resourcing**: When it comes to allocating budget, we will strongly prefer investing in AI that increases the leverage of our current team members over adding new team members. For any problem we're trying to solve with a new hire, we should all ask how we could solve it with AI first.

AI consistently reduces the drudgery that keeps each of us from doing higher-value work and speeds up the development of new ideas. How AI gets used in any given role will naturally vary.Â  For your particular role, my team and I will work with your manager to establish clear AI expectations. We will learn together how to raise both the ceiling on possibilities and the floor on efficiency.

## We will learn to use AI together

Becoming fluent with AI tools is a journey that starts with playing to learn.Â  If you haven't tried ChatGPT or other AI tools, you should; there's no substitute or shortcut around this phase.Â  If you aren't yet playing with AI, you are behind the adoption curve of where you need to be.Â  The good news: thanks to their natural language interfaces, AI tools are mostly intuitive, and the learning curve is often short.

Once you've solved a few problems with AI tools, you'll begin to see patterns, and how you can incorporate them into your workflows will become more clear.Â  This is where you should be.Â  At this stage, you can begin to share your wins and discoveries with others to accelerate their own adoption.

There is no shame and only glory in figuring out how to get AI to take your hard tasks and do them for you. Managers will encourage more open sharing of what works especially among your peers in similar roles. These skills are all learnable.

We'll invest in tools like ChatGPT Enterprise, Claude, Conveyor, Goose, Github Copilot, and others as well as training for these applications to help our teams do more high-value work and deliver more for customers.

## The path ahead has risks and opportunities

AI has increased the breadth and depth of our opportunity. Fully embracing this incredible technology means we are better equipped than ever to deliver for customers in existing ways and new ways.

At the same time, AI has increased the risk that someone else will serve our market better than we do. Our past assumptions about how our product can help companies build relationships with their customers are no longer enough to realize our ambitions. We have a massive headstart on anyone who thinks they can serve customers better than we can, but we also must bring AI into our product and internal processes, or we will lose the opportunity to be part of our customersâ€™ futures.

The gap between those who do and donâ€™t fully adopt AI is widening. **We must act now and decisively to remain on the winning side of the divide.** I believe youâ€™re here because you, like me, are excited by the ability to have a major impact while growing professionally. There has never been a better time in our industry or our company for you to do both.
