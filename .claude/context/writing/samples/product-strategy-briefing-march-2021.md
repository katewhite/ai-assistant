# Product Strategy Briefing (Mar '21)

## Context

[One year ago we](https://www.notion.so/390d6ee472e2442d9561777feea9a8c1?pvs=21) established the north star of messaging share, stretched ourselves to take on more projects in parallel, and made habits of many fundamental product team operations. We built the muscle to deliver a steady stream of new customer value, are regularly improving user experience, and made customer interaction a day-to-day habit. All that contributes to consistently high satisfaction ratings among app users and low churn rates we can be proud of.

At the same time, we've stumbled when attempting to deliver on projects that demand a larger scope of changes to achieve ambitious outcomes. It wasn't until the end 2020 we started putting messaging share improvements into market, long after we declared the intent. We've been stronger when delivering small refinements than big innovations.

As a company, we've achieved our strongest ever financial position and plan to leverage it to achieve a [mind-boggling 10 year vision](https://customerio.slack.com/files/U02579KEN/F01K201MVAQ/2030_vision.pdf). Let's prepare to lead the way toward this vision!

## Higher Intent

From Colin: Figure out how to go a little faster, or be a little bit better everywhere across the company to help jumpstart our progress towards the 2030 vision.

For Product: *Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run.*

## My Intent

<aside>
â­ **Make our squads more entrepreneurial in order to increase our pace of innovation and set a team culture ready to tackle the 2030 vision.**

</aside>

An entrepreneurial squad culture has these key elements:

- Owns customer outcomes with urgency. Finds a way to start learning faster in market.
- Is resourceful. Focuses on progress by pushing to find minimal creative solutions.
- Gives radically candid feedback while showing genuine care for colleagues.
- Asks for help. Takes the personal risk of admitting when something is broken.
- Develops and pitches ideas. Is attuned to company strategy while creating space to explore.
- Is fearless. Takes risks to learn quickly and doesn't punish when well-executed ideas fail.

## Instructions for my team

### Everyone: Role models for entrepreneurial squads

Let's bring the ðŸ”¥ to our squads each day and be role models to the company of what small empowered teams can accomplish. This means actively encouraging the elements listed above even when it feels uncomfortable.

This doesn't mean longer hours, neglecting family, skipping your workout, or avoiding vacations. Invest in yourself with the same vigor you invest in our product. Keep your personal energy at a level where you can come to work and motivate your squad sustainably.

If it's me slowing things down, then don't hold back on giving me feedback. Hold me accountable for creating the environment where this culture can thrive. 

### Madeline: Scaling design quality

I'd like you to focus on delivering a consistently high level of quality for all our design output  across every customer touchpoint. As squads act more entrepreneurial and as we shape our brand, we must actively put practices in place to resist diverging from our design system or neglecting our principles.

This focus is higher priority than any individual deliverable and may mean major changes to your day-to-day role. Build your delegation skills and challenge your team by giving them increasing levels of ownership.

In particular, I want you to guide us through adjusting our design process to complement our goal of shipping in smaller pieces (as Matthew emphasizes in [the engineering intent](https://www.notion.so/e324e1ebbbc94d6cad2c348d99c0d83f?pvs=21)) by pushing us to iterate quickly and not walk away until we're proud of the experience.

### Kate: Customer satisfaction

Customers choose to stay with us because we've consistently prioritized the everyday experience of marketing/product practitioners using our product. An ever increasing number of customers and corresponding internal support staff means large volumes of feedback. Your most important responsibility is cutting through all this volume to select a backlog of clearly scoped, high-leverage changes. 

Watch out for over-investing in any one area. Unless something is truly "rapid response" then be willing to say no to (lots of) things that only impact small numbers of customers in order to keep your velocity high. 

The list of possibilities is more than one squad can reasonably deliver against (Content Management, Testing, Conversions, Subscription Management, etc). Remember that your mission is identifying changes that are high leverage in increasing satisfaction, rather than delivering a particular solution in any one area. As we hire, we'll bring more ðŸ’ª to support this!

### LJ: Messaging share for mobile app builders

Our target customers are software builders and consumers are expecting them to deliver mobile apps alongside their web apps. Our offering for mobile app builders is inferior in the market and it's a top reason for losing prospects and churning customers. Bring us up to a competitive offering so it's no longer a dealbreaker. Let's take advantage of being late to the game by learning where our competitors fall short.

While our clearest gaps are around ease-of-integration for push and we need to get that to market fast, please take the time to start from by analyzing the problems most impacting mobile app builders. You may find other things (e.g. geolocation, SMS, WhatsApp, or ad-networks) are actually bigger problems for mobile app builders than SDK features our customers have.

### Chad: Developer learning experience

Please continue on the path you started with the API docs, ensuring that our product and mobile documentation tools are also set up to support our ability to make changes quickly and predictably. As you launch these on new platforms, work closely with the design and frontend teams to make sure all docs reflect our design system and feel like one consistent experience with the website and the app.

Once you get our docs platforms operating well, the next focus is auditing and rethinking our content! To add momentum to our messaging share strategy I'd like you to focus on making us as developer friendly as possible. Look at other dev-focused products and what they do in their docs. We should feel more like Stripe/Netlify/AWS than Mailchimp/Squarespace. Be mindful to preserve safe paths for folks who never touch code, but it's most important that we feel familiar and native among the cohort of leading developer tools.

Be loud about it any time you see potential changes to the website or product what will support this mission.

### Brendan: Leads as steps toward a reusable data layer

As a top priority, stay focused on the outcome of capturing the leads component of customer messaging share. While a more expansive vision for how we manage data is budding and must be nurtured, we cannot neglect the core problem we set out to solve. Don't stop until you are confident that we've cleared the blockers for a majority of customers to bring us that early lifecycle component of their messaging. Coordinate closely with the mobile effort to ensure that app builders are also able to send their lead messages. As we ship features that remove identity management as a blocker, it may become unclear how much progress we're making into these new use cases. Find ways of reporting our progress so we don't over/under invest.

All that said, the data management concepts you and Matthew are exploring to solve the leads gaps are also a foundational component to how we start on the journey to the 2030 vision. We will need an architectural layer that supports managing identity/objects across many sources and makes that pool of data available in a flexible workflow automation context as well as future potential sales, support, and product team use cases. This is still very fuzzy, so start by defining some clear achievable milestones that line up customer value for whatever we select for a first adjacent opportunity later in the year.
