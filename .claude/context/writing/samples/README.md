# Writing Samples

This directory is for writing style samples and reference documents.

## Purpose

Add writing samples here that demonstrate the desired writing style. These samples are used by the writing assistant command for style reference only—their content should not be considered for Intelligems-specific context.

## Current Samples

The writing assistant references knowledge files starting with "WRITING SAMPLE" for style guidance, including:

- Paul Graham essays (Write Simply, How to Write Usefully, Write Like You Talk, Good Writing)
- Customer.io product strategy briefings
- Customer.io CEO writing samples

## Usage

When adding new samples, ensure they demonstrate clear, concise, direct writing that communicates ideas effectively. The writing assistant will use these for style reference when helping create product documents.
