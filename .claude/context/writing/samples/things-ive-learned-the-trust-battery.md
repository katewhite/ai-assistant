# Things Iâ€™ve Learned: The Trust Battery

> Most people have a bad idea of what trust is, they think itâ€™s binaryâ€”you either trust someone or you donâ€™t. In reality, itâ€™s more of a gradient.â€

The trust battery concept is pretty straightforward:

When you first start working with someone new, your trust battery is around 50%. Each time you have a positive interaction, your trust battery increases. Each time you have a negative interaction, your trust battery decreases.Â In my relationships with each of you or my friends or family, thereâ€™s a trust battery and a trust level for every person.

### How big and charged are your trust batteries?

Long term relationships that are positive create bigger trust batteries. Big trust batteries help relationships weather storms. For example, my trust battery with John Allison has gone up and down over the 8 years weâ€™ve been working together. Recently my trust battery with John has been increasing. John has been able to spend time with me strategizing about the business. Heâ€™s also taken on the responsibility for TS and CS with enthusiasm and a positive outlook.

Between different parts of the company thereâ€™s a trust battery as well. Do product squads deliver new features when they say they will? When sales hands a new customer over to the CS team, are they well taken care of? Can our deliverability team help my customer improve their sending practices?

When trust batteries are low people make comments like â€œthose people donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doingâ€ or â€œwhy canâ€™t that team seem to get anything done?â€.

### High trust lets you be vulnerable

A functioning company has high trust between both the people and the teams in the company. When you have high trust, you assume others are well-intentioned. You give them the benefit of the doubt. Having a charged trust battery for people around you sets you at ease and allows you to be vulnerable. It allows you to make and admit mistakes without fear of criticism. In front of the people on our leadership team I know I can be vulnerable and that helps me do my best work.

Situations get sticky when trust batteries get low. A simple mistake becomes the end of the world. An innocuous decision becomes a direct affront.

### High trust leads to higher trust

A company is a collection of trust batteries. Positive interactions happen because people trust each other. More trust creates more positive interactions (and more trust)! It's a beautiful reinforcing cycle. When trust batteries are low, negative interactions can create a negative spiral. That removes trust from the system.

I want to make sure enough trust exists across our company so we can work well together. Each interaction should increase our collective trust battery capacity. I look around the company and consider: Do our teams trust each other? Does our leadership trust each other? Do managers trust each member of their teams?

### What to do when trust batteries lose charge

Here's a suggestion from an article on trust batteries:

> For instance, letâ€™s say that Sam didnâ€™t deliver on an important project. Confronting him with a statement like â€œSam, youâ€™re not trustworthy,â€ would only make him defensive. You would have an ever harder time restoring trust this way. With a shared company metaphor like the trust battery, you can make a more effective statement like: â€œSam, my trust battery with you is really low right now. You said youâ€™d get me this deliverable and it didnâ€™t come through. Help me understand why because I want my trust with you to be high.â€ Samâ€™s not likely to be as reactive and itâ€™s a much easier conversation to navigate, right?-Â [https://organizationalphysics.com/2016/06/21/how-full-is-your-trust-battery/](https://organizationalphysics.com/2016/06/21/how-full-is-your-trust-battery/)

It has taken me time and lots of mistakes to realize we need to address situations that are removing trust. Someone is stressed out and needs a vacation to recharge. Someone else was a bad hire and their peers lost trust in them. Sometimes it's more complex than that.

The â€œtrust batteryâ€ concept gives us a way to communicate with each other. We can use it as a way to be transparent when we see our trust batteries for other people on the team going up or down.
