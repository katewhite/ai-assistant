# Unless I Hear Differently

One ofÂ [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles)Â is:

> Bias for Action. Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
> 

At Customer.io our ResponsibilityÂ [core value](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NnbA1w0Oaz8tJKHA9wOXZ1y99XT3lh8fl_x5SLvMYUA/edit#)Â tries to encourage aÂ *bias for action*. In our company values doc we give an example:

> A team member is out sick but recently deployed a bug to production. You can fix the issue, and there's nobody else around. You fix it!
> 

I've since learned and practiced a modification of this behavior for about 6 months that's even more powerful. Using a phrase like "unless I hear differently..." when talking about an action you're going to take.

# "Unless I hear differently..."

Here's how to apply this at work:

1. Next time you're faced with a problem, come up with what you think is a good action to take to solve the problem. 
2. Before you take action, publicly explain what you will do and why. 
3. Provide the research that indicates why this action is the right one at this time and what else you considered.
4. Give stakeholders time to give feedback on the action before it happens.
5. Take the action and report back on your learnings or observations.

If you approach all the steps with integrity, you are practicing it well. If you decide to skip a step, you may be choosing the wrong action. â€œUnless I hear differentlyâ€¦â€ is meant to empower informed decision-making, not poor judgment.

A couple of examples from our Slack:Â 

ZackÂ N [said](https://customerio.slack.com/archives/C22M3536F/p1520022396000304?thread_ts=1520000178.000670&cid=C22M3536F):Â *"I'll work on my demo account unless I hear otherwise."*Â 

JulieÂ [said](https://customerio.slack.com/archives/C0265RC3T/p1506443435000669)Â : *"Unless, I hear otherwise Iâ€™m going to go forward with this approach and create a test batch for you 2 to review."*

# Why is that so powerful?

- Something (*rather than nothing*) will happen by default. No one else needs to DO anything for that action to happen.
- It allows you to make progress even if you're only 90% positive that's the right course of action.
- The decision to take the action is made in the open (basecamp / slack) so key people are aware of something before it changes.
- If people can also see the reasoning you're using to make the decision, critical understanding and knowledge spread more quickly in our team.

I'd encourage you to give "Unless I hear differently" a try with something small in a project even if there's just one other person involved. From there expand it to more situations as your confidence to have a bias for action grows.

# **Q&A**

MaggieÂ proposed some questions that might help clarify this idea further:

**1. What happens if I mess up?**

Everyone messes up. The key is to learn something from the mistake. There are limited ways to get "unless I hear differently" wrong:Â 

a.) There's a serious, hard to reverse change and while you did everything right, nobody saw that you were going to make the change before you did. Lesson: Make sure stakeholders are aware before you take actions that have serious consequences.

b.) It didn't work out as expected. Lesson: That's ok! I bet you learned something. That's a great time to follow up and say "My thing didn't work out. I'm going to try to fix it... unless I hear differently..."

**2. If I really don't know what to do, should I ask for advice?**

Sure! The next best thing is to bring the options you considered as well as your concerns with the options to someone else to review.

**3. I'm a manager, how can I make sure to support this?**

Point out the behavior when you see people saying "Unless I hear differently...". Support people when they bias toward action with coaching and feedback.

**4. As a manager, what are some of the things I might be doing that don't support this?**

Making yourself responsible for solving all the problems rather than encouraging others to own them.Â 

Overriding peoples decisions when they do have a solution and just telling people what to do.
