### Mission

### Three-Year Vision

We exist to transform the way companies communicate with customers by building an engagement platform that powers sophisticated, automated engagement without needing to write code. Our customers choose us because we help them deliver a superior customer experience at a far lower cost. We have found success by riding the wave of every company needing to digitally transform to become powered by software. 

As we look to the future, this digital transformation is being led by the growth function. These are the people who are responsible with building go-to-market capabilities that are highly scalable by leveraging technology and integrating marketing+sales with their product.

By prioritizing the needs of this group, we have an opportunity over the next 3 years to help far more companies with their transformation and accelerate the ones who already have. Here is how we will get there:

### **1. Deliver the â€œHoly Grail of Customer Growthâ€**

We aim to transform our platform into a growth engine for our customers, allowing them to directly quantify the impact of our software on their business performance. Our strategies include:

- **Quantifiable Impact:** Provide clear metrics that demonstrate how our platform increases revenue and drives tangible results for our customers.
- **Be the All-in-One Engagement Platform:** Become the consolidated solution that companies choose for their needs with support for marketing and product communication channels and data connections to help them run their business.
- **Powerful yet approachable:** Practitioners feel like they have superpowers when using the platform to accomplish tasks. We do a lot of the heavy lifting through consumer grade UX and AI tools so that they can focus on the experiences theyâ€™ll deliver to their customers.

### **2. Accelerate Growth to $230 Million ARR**

Our goal is to reach $230 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), representing a 40% year-over-year growth from our targeted $83 million ARR by the end of 2024. To achieve this, we will:

- **Develop a Scalable Growth Engine:** Use our own software to remove friction in our conversion from trial or demo to paid, refine our cross-sell and upsell to unlock the full potential of our top down and bottoms up go to market motion. Expand our outbound and partner acquisition channels.
- **Balance Growth and Profitability:** Aim to operate within the â€œRule of 40â€ (the sum of our growth rate and profit margin), but remain flexible to invest more when strategic opportunities arise.
- **Operate with Public Company Discipline:** Adopt the rigor of a public company to prepare us for various strategic alternatives, including an IPO, M&A, or private market financing transactions.

By committing to these objectives and **fostering a culture of innovation and excellence**, Customer.io will not only achieve remarkable growth but also deliver exceptional value to our customers and stakeholders. There are no guarantees that weâ€™ll succeed, but if we do, it will be because we held ourselves to a high standard, raised the bar for talent, solved challenges creatively and with urgency, and innovated faster than our competitors to transform how companies communicate with customers.
