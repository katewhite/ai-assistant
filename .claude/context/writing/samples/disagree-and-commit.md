# Disagree and Commit

One of the hard things about going from 2 people in a room to 40 people in a company is that I have to accept that for almost anything that is happening in the company, someone else has spent more energy, given more thought and more consideration on it than me. Sometimes that means I’m in situations where what someone is recommending goes against the information in my brain. Who is right? Do they see something I don’t? Or does my experience give me insight they haven’t gotten yet.

The lesson I learned is that it doesn’t matter if I’m right. What’s important is that I trust the people on the team to make good decisions. Sure, I want the opportunity to weigh in on decisions we make but once I’ve said my piece either in support or disagreement, it’s time for me to get on board.

I learned about this concept in a book by Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel but [Disagree and Commit](http://tomtunguz.com/disagree-and-commit/) was reinforced by Amazon and a story about Jeff Bezos:

> *In one instance, he says, he disagreed with his team about moving forward with one Amazon Studios original production, worried it wouldn’t be interesting enough to viewers or might be too complicated to execute.*
> 

> *But because he trusted them and wanted to save time, he went for it.*
> 

> *He wrote, “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.”*
> 

It’s easier to find reasons why something might not work than it is to get behind an idea or team and support it wholeheartedly. It takes energy to be positive and lift up your peers. On the flip side, voicing opposition after a decision is made sucks the wind out of everyone’s sails and leaves people feeling drained. I expect that key people in a decision have the opportunity to voice opinions but when the decision maker picks a direction, we support it to give the team working to make it reality the best opportunity to see it through to success.

We have to trust that the people who are closer to it know what they’re doing and that new, better information might invalidate our own assessment of things. That’s how you empower others and trust that good things will happen when you do.
