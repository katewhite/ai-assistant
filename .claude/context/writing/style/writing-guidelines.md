# Writing Guidelines

## Writing Style guidelines

Not just for brief writing, these guidelines will help you communicate more objectively, building credibility with your peers and managers.

| Tip | Not Acceptable | Acceptable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replace adjectives with data (Use specifics, not superlatives) | The team performed really well last month, bringing in a lot of new customers. | The team brought in 15 new customers in April, an increase of 5 from the previous month. With the current marketing efforts, we anticipate this number will increase at the same rate for the next three months. |
|  | Eliminating the existing server issues will require considerable effort. | Fixing the problems in our code will take a back end engineer 20 hours, and will involve shutting down the site for 1.5 hours to install new code. |
| Focus on one idea per sentence | We have noticed an uptick in deliverability issues and a lot of churn from crypto customers. | We have noticed a 15% increase in spam rates over our entire customer base in the last 30 days. 10% of our customers in the crypto industry churned last month, representing $1,000 in revenue. |
| Strip Out qualifiers | I think we need to increase our premium entry point | We need to increase our premium entry point |
| Avoid using individualâ€™s names. 

**Why:** Reduce cognitive load of reader and write as one team. | Tom and Jerry exposed two security vulnerabilities in their audit of our billing systems. | The SRE team exposed two security vulnerabilities in their audit of our billing systems. |
| Avoid abbreviations, jargon, and slang | The COGs for customers in the Premium ARR tier have increased by 5% while overages remain flat. | The cost of goods (COGs; i.e. hosting, storage) for customers in our Premium tier (Annual Recurring Revenue [ARR] greater than ~$995/mo) have increased by 5% (from 1 to 1.05), while overages remain flat. |
| Use data to describe changes over time. | There was an increase in sales this quarter.  | Net new Premium revenue increased by 15% QoQ ($11.5M in Q2 v. $10M in Q1), which is primarily attributable to signing two new customers: Coca Cola at $400k ACV and GMC at $500k ACV). |

### Real-life examples by functional area

**Technical Support**

> Q2 agent productivity averaged 9.7 contacts/hr, down slightly from Q1â€™s 9.83 (-1%) due to continued onboarding and turnover at both ABC and our DEF center. This is unfavorable to the original financial plan by 11%; however, favorable to the updated plan by 1%.
> 

**Marketing**

> ***Traffic and new trials*** broadly trended downwards over the course of Q2, **primarily as a result of relatively conservative levels of paid ad spend.** The level of paid ad spend has long been one of the primary drivers of changes in the volumes and rates of funnel metrics. For example, this behavior can be seen at the beginning of June 2022, when paid search bids were increased; as a result, Traffic climbed from 5,453 to 6,437 over the course of June
(+18%), with new trials (+19%) showing corresponding increases.

**Product**

> FEATURE_NAME (Red for 9/30 with de-risk plan underway) we are currently partnering with THIRDPARTY to fully sketch out requirements. The project has been hindered by lack of resource availability at the company both in terms of a technical resource to capture API requirements and also subject matter experts in how FEATURE_NAMEâ€™s operate currently within the THIRDPARTY. Timelines on requirements have already slipped by more than a month at THIRDPARTY. We have also met some resistance to revisiting manual processes in an effort to foster a fully digital experience. We are continuing to work through these challenges with our partners at the THIRDPARTY. To get this project back on track we need THIRDPARTY to capture API requirements no later than 4/30.

## The Brief Process

Have you ever been asked to review a project or deliverable for a co-worker and struggle to quickly understand what the purpose of the project is, who the audience is, or what will make the project successful? If so, a project brief can help communicate those key details to you or other stakeholders and ensure that your feedback is relevant and most importantly, that the project is successful!

### Where do I start?

1. **Write the brief for yourself first.** This is a tool that can help you think through solving a problem holistically. If you know you have a blind spot when it comes to customer experience, the Customer Experience section will force you to think through that.
2. **Write the brief so itâ€™s easy for people to understand.** Use clear, objective language (see style guidelines below) to describe the situation so everyone has the facts, can draw their own conclusions, and get up to speed quickly.
3. **You are not alone!** Donâ€™t assume that writing a brief means you are writing it alone. Use the expertise of your teammates and peers to fill out the various sections. For example, you may need help from the data or finance teams to model out the financial impact of a change to the customer experience. Conversely, you are responsible for challenging and/or verifying the data that others provide.
4. **Your first draft should be terrible.** Start by getting the ideas on â€œpaperâ€ before trying to make them perfect. You may find yourself editing the first few sections (Situation/Complications/Strategy) several times before diving into the Solution. There may be a great temptation to start with the Solution, but that may only limit your thinking.

### What should I include in a brief?

- **Situation or problem statement** - Whatâ€™s causing you to write the brief? What problem are you out to solve?
    - Iâ€™m out of cookies.
- **Complications** - What other forces make the problem especially important to solve?
    - The grocery store near my house has closed.
    - The grocery store across town is too far to walk to.
- **Strategy** - In two or fewer sentences, what is the proposed high-level action that will solve the problem?
    - I will bake my own cookies.
- **Solution** - What is the more specific body of work required to fulfill the strategy?
    - Use grocery delivery app to deliver enough ingredients to prepare 3 doz. dough balls and freeze 90% for on-demand baking.
- **Timeline** - How long will the project take?
    - Estimate 1 hour for grocery delivery
    - 1-2 hours for ingredient mixing and dough balling
    - Recurring 25-minute baking cycles (incl. oven preheating)
- **Resources** - Who will be doing the work, and what is their role in the project? Ideally, this is set up similar to a RACI matrix
    - Responsible: Me, Shopper, Dog (cleanup)
    - Accountable: Me
    - Consulted: Nobody tells me what kind of cookies to bake.
    - Informed: Neighbors
- **Customer Experience** - More often than not, your work impacts the customer (or pre-customer) experience. Describe it in as much detail as possible whether in writing, flowcharts, mockups, or basic hand sketches. This exercise often helps you think of things youâ€™ve missed.
- **Press Release** - For bigger projects or feature releases it can be helpful to write a fake press release ***first***. It helps you work backward and keep the customer outcomes first. ([**sample**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/working-backwards-press-release-template-example-ian-mcallister/))
    - Local resident cancels Nabisco, McVittieâ€™s in favor of home-baked cookiesâ€¦
- **Financials** - What is the financial impact of implementing (or not implementing) this work? How much will it cost us? If itâ€™s a long-term investment, how does the investment change over time?
    - Ingredients for 3 doz cookies - $15, 25% savings from store-bought
    - Tip for grocery shopper - $4
    - Gas/Electricity for baking - $0.05
- **Goals** - What do you expect to accomplish? Make sure this is measurable, realistic, and has a date.
    - 90% cookie availability (cookies available > 329 days/year)
    - Neighbor agrees to watch dog (cookie bribes) 1 weekend this year
    - Reduce cookie-related expenses by 20%
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** - What metrics will change in the business or in your department as a result of this work? A KPI is just a metric, or â€œmeasureâ€, like â€œnumber of cookies in your pantryâ€â€¦If we wanted to increase the number of cookies in the pantry by 10%, that would be a goal.
    - Dollars saved by home baking
- **Other Considerations** - What other strategies or solutions did you consider before choosing this one? Why didnâ€™t they pass muster?
    - Have mom bake me cookies
