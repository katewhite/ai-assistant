# Understanding Adam Kitain: Vision, Values, and Leadership at Intelligems

## Background and Vision as Co-Founder of Intelligems

Adam Kitain is the co-founder and CTO of Intelligems, a Colorado-based
startup offering a **"profit growth platform"** for e-commerce
brands[\[1\]](https://art19.com/shows/my-biggest-lesson/episodes/201013a6-6bd5-41e6-8a95-99b25bc7aaf8#:~:text=This%20week%C2%A0Adam%20Burrows%C2%A0speaks%20with%20Adam,first).
His journey began at Via, a ride-sharing company, where he led the
engineering team for pricing algorithms while his future Intelligems
co-founder, Drew Marconi, led revenue
operations[\[2\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=Adam%20and%20Drew%20met%20in,So%E2%80%A6yeah%2C%20they%E2%80%99re%20smart).
Together at Via, they built dynamic pricing systems -- including a
powerful price A/B testing engine that could **"validate any hypothesis
by running a test in the real world and delivering a statistically
significant answer"**, dramatically improving
profitability[\[3\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=The%20most%20powerful%20pricing%20tool,customer%20lifetime%20values%20skyrocketing%204x).
This experience showed them how influential data-driven pricing could be
beyond ride-sharing, inspiring them to bring the same sophistication to
the broader e-commerce
industry[\[4\]](https://www.builtincolorado.com/articles/intelligems-raises-4m-e-commerce#:~:text=Prior%20to%20launching%20their%20own,and%20decided%20to%20build%20Intelligems).
In 2021, Kitain and Marconi launched Intelligems through Techstars,
aiming to give even small and mid-sized merchants access to
**Amazon/Uber-level pricing tools** for optimizing revenue and
margins[\[5\]](https://www.builtincolorado.com/articles/intelligems-raises-4m-e-commerce#:~:text=Intelligems%20works%20by%20integrating%C2%A0with%20Shopify,free%20shipping%20and%20free%20returns)[\[6\]](https://www.builtincolorado.com/articles/intelligems-raises-4m-e-commerce#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20type%20of%20tool%20helps,%E2%80%9D).
Today, Intelligems enables online brands to experiment with product
prices, shipping fees, discounts, and on-site content in order to
maximize profit. Adam's **long-term vision (1--3 years)** is to evolve
Intelligems into the **"central nervous system"** for merchant
decision-making -- a platform where every lever (pricing, promotions,
content, etc.) is optimized through
data[\[7\]](https://www.stage2.capital/blog/investing-in-intelligems-why-were-betting-on-profit-growth#:~:text=Intelligems%20is%20positioned%20to%20become,Factors%20include).
In line with this vision, he is guiding Intelligems to expand beyond
Shopify into larger retailers and even other industries, effectively
**"bringing dynamic pricing power to as many types of stores and
industries as
possible"**[\[6\]](https://www.builtincolorado.com/articles/intelligems-raises-4m-e-commerce#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20type%20of%20tool%20helps,%E2%80%9D).
This big-picture ambition reflects how Adam thinks: empower businesses
of all sizes with advanced tools to drive profitable growth, a
capability once reserved for tech giants.

## Data-Driven Decisions and a Testing Mindset

Central to Adam Kitain's thinking is a deep trust in **data-driven
decision making**. He has often emphasized the importance of
experimentation and evidence over gut feeling. At Intelligems, **every
idea or hypothesis is expected to be tested and validated by real data**
rather than assumed. This mindset was evident from the very first
product Adam built -- a price A/B testing tool -- and remains a core
philosophy. *"Dynamic pricing is essential to compete... however, using
data-driven results to inform your pricing strategies is equally as
important,"* he notes, after running thousands of price tests to learn
what customers are truly willing to
pay[\[8\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/why-every-store-should-price-like-uber#:~:text=Dynamic%20pricing%20is%20essential%20to,are%20willing%20to%20pay%20for).
In practice, this means that when new product initiatives or features
are proposed, Adam will likely ask: *"How do we test it?"* He believes
that **rigorous experimentation yields the most accurate answers** and
often cites the surprising insights that testing can reveal. For
example, Intelligems' analysis of over 1,000 price experiments found
that more than half the time, a better price exists than what a merchant
had set -- and in 59% of those cases the optimal price was actually
*lower* than the
original[\[9\]](https://thefringe.hellorep.ai/p/the-fringe-1000-ecommerce-pricing-tests#:~:text=1.%20Many%20small%20and%20medium,understand%20consumers%27%20willingness%20to%20pay).
Such findings underscore Adam's view that relying on intuition alone can
leave money on the table, and only through controlled experiments can a
business discover the true *price elasticity* and customer preferences
for their
products[\[10\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/why-every-store-should-price-like-uber#:~:text=optimal%20price%20strategy%20is%20what,their%20customers%20willing%20to%20pay)[\[8\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/why-every-store-should-price-like-uber#:~:text=Dynamic%20pricing%20is%20essential%20to,are%20willing%20to%20pay%20for).
In team discussions, Adam consistently advocates **"trusting data over
intuition"** and iterating quickly based on test
results[\[11\]](https://podtail.com/podcast/honest-ecommerce/bonus-episode-big-swings-vs-small-wins-embracing-t/#:~:text=move,16%3A33%5D%20Assessing%20business%20lifecycle).
Even when an A/B test fails to beat the control, he sees value: a
so-called "non-winning" result still yields learnings that inform the
next iteration. This **embrace of continuous improvement** means that
Adam responds to ambitious ideas with both enthusiasm and pragmatism --
he encourages big swings, but insists on measuring their impact. As one
investor noted, Adam and his team are *"grounded in data"* and have
pushed for efficiency at every
turn[\[12\]](https://www.stage2.capital/blog/investing-in-intelligems-why-were-betting-on-profit-growth#:~:text=Co,capitalize%20on%20the%20opportunity%20ahead).
In short, Adam Kitain thinks like a scientist-product manager: he
approaches product strategies as hypotheses to test, uses metrics
(notably profit metrics) as the guiding star, and is quick to pivot or
double-down based on what the **evidence** shows.

## Profit-First Philosophy and Focus on Key Metrics

Another critical aspect of Adam's mindset is his **profit-first
philosophy**. He is not swayed by vanity metrics or growth at any cost;
instead, he emphasizes sustainable unit economics and real profitability
for merchants. One of his oft-cited mantras is the classic business
saying: *"Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is king."* In
practice, Adam insists that the ultimate measure of success for any
experiment or initiative should be its impact on **profitability**, not
just conversion rates or
revenue[\[13\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/the-only-metric-you-need-when-ab-testing#:~:text=,is%20making%20more%20money%2C%20right).
This perspective led Intelligems to champion a metric called **profit
per visitor (PPV)**. *"At Intelligems, we firmly believe that profit per
visitor is the most important metric to look at... It takes into
consideration revenue, the variable cost of fulfilling that revenue, and
conversion rate,"* Adam writes, noting that PPV effectively captures
what every e-commerce brand should care about at the end of the day --
total contribution
profit[\[14\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/the-only-metric-you-need-when-ab-testing#:~:text=Many%20people%20debate%20over%20the,profit%2C%20or%20something%20else%20altogether)[\[15\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/the-only-metric-you-need-when-ab-testing#:~:text=Image%3A%20profitpervisitor_img).
By focusing on profit per site visitor, Adam ensures that Intelligems'
product decisions align with merchants' bottom-line health. For example,
if a new feature is proposed, he will likely evaluate it by asking: will
this help our customers make more **net profit**, or just inflate
top-line numbers? If an idea only drives sales volume at the expense of
margins, Adam might be skeptical unless it serves a longer-term
strategy. This profit-focused lens traces back to his experience at Via,
where he saw how smart pricing dramatically improved lifetime value and
profitability[\[16\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=The%20most%20powerful%20pricing%20tool,customer%20lifetime%20values%20skyrocketing%204x).
It's also reflected in Intelligems' investor support -- Stage 2 Capital
described how Adam and Drew apply a **"profit-first lens"** to solving
e-commerce pricing, positioning Intelligems to optimize merchants'
overall performance across pricing, shipping, and
promotions[\[12\]](https://www.stage2.capital/blog/investing-in-intelligems-why-were-betting-on-profit-growth#:~:text=Co,capitalize%20on%20the%20opportunity%20ahead).
In the next 1--3 years, Adam's product vision revolves around expanding
these profit optimization capabilities. He has already led Intelligems
to move beyond simple price tests into areas like free shipping
thresholds, discount personalization, and content testing -- all with
the goal of turning every website visitor into a **profitable customer**
for the
brand[\[7\]](https://www.stage2.capital/blog/investing-in-intelligems-why-were-betting-on-profit-growth#:~:text=Intelligems%20is%20positioned%20to%20become,Factors%20include).
In summary, **commercial viability and ROI are paramount in Adam
Kitain's decision-making**. He encourages the team to pursue ideas that
drive measurable profit uplift for clients, and he defines success in
terms of metrics like incremental gross profit, profit per visitor, and
long-term customer value rather than just growth for growth's
sake[\[17\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/the-only-metric-you-need-when-ab-testing#:~:text=By%20looking%20at%20this%20metric%2C,and%20acquisition%20spend%20as%20well)[\[18\]](https://thefringe.hellorep.ai/p/the-fringe-1000-ecommerce-pricing-tests#:~:text=2,retailers%20often%20overprice%20their%20products).

## Customer-Centric Values and the "Be Helpful" Ethos

While Adam is data-driven and profit-focused, he equally prioritizes
being **customer-centric** in both product design and company culture.
In fact, Intelligems' top core value (codified on their website) is
*"putting our customers first,"* followed closely by *"be
helpful."*[\[19\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=match%20at%20L369%20helpful%2C%20which,helpful%20goes%20beyond%20our%20customers)
Adam exemplifies these values in his leadership style. He strongly
believes that **going the extra mile for customers** -- even in ways
that don't scale or aren't directly tied to revenue -- builds trust,
loyalty, and long-term success. *"Being helpful and saying yes and going
above and beyond for people... more often than not, it always pays
off,"* Adam said of his biggest lesson
learned[\[20\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=which%20is%20being%20helpful%20and,and%20it%20always%20pays%20off).
This ethos is not just talk; Adam has countless stories of rolling up
his sleeves to assist customers and partners. In Intelligems' early
days, he personally helped merchants fix website issues that weren't
even caused by Intelligems, simply because they asked for help. He
recalls acting as a "theme developer" for some of the first clients,
debugging unrelated site problems to ensure those brands
succeeded[\[21\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=so%20much%20time%20helping%20them,didn%27t%20know%20about%20that%20we).
Those efforts made customers *"ecstatic and so grateful"* that they
often referred new business or became enthusiastic
advocates[\[22\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=,our%20company%20values%20and%20we).
Adam explicitly instills this mindset into Intelligems' culture -- *"Be
Helpful"* is a formal company value, extending **beyond customers to
partners and the broader
community**[\[19\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=match%20at%20L369%20helpful%2C%20which,helpful%20goes%20beyond%20our%20customers)[\[23\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=helpful%2C%20which%20is%20number%20two,helpful%20goes%20beyond%20our%20customers).
For example, Adam is known to collaborate with technology partners to
A/B test joint value propositions or to prove integrations work well for
a mutual client, even if Intelligems isn't directly paid for that
work[\[24\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=,sometimes%20it%27s%20technology%20partners%20and).
He sees these above-and-beyond assists as investments in goodwill. As he
explains, spending even 20 minutes to help a merchant troubleshoot a
problem (whether or not Intelligems caused it) *"buys a lot of trust and
that goes a long
way"*[\[25\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=match%20at%20L361%20us%2C%20but,yeah%2C%20it%27s%20kind%20of%20corny).
This **customer-first mentality** means that when evaluating new ideas
or initiatives, Adam will weigh their impact on customers heavily. If a
proposed feature might inconvenience users or compromise the merchant's
customer experience, he'll be cautious. Conversely, he's enthusiastic
about ideas that enhance customer value or service -- for instance,
developing tools that increase merchants' transparency with shoppers
(such as the tariff passthrough app Intelligems built to openly show
fees[\[26\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog#:~:text=Product%20Updates)[\[27\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog#:~:text=Adam%20Kitain))
or improving the support experience. It's telling that Intelligems'
largest team today is not engineering but customer success/support,
reflecting Adam's commitment to customer-centric
growth[\[28\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=match%20at%20L421%20this%20team,literally%20a%20third%20of%20the).
Internally, colleagues find that Adam is approachable and eager to help
solve problems, embodying the *"be helpful"* spirit with his own team as
well. However, he also encourages balance -- he acknowledges that saying
yes to everything has limits if it detracts from other customers'
needs[\[29\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=match%20at%20L412%20means%20that,know%2C%20but%20there%27s%20nothing%20else).
Overall, **Adam Kitain's values center on treating customers like
partners**, listening to their needs, and delivering more value than
expected. He would rather over-deliver on service and create raving fans
than take a short-term shortcut. This high-touch, customer-centric
approach has been critical in shaping Intelligems' reputation and will
continue to guide how Adam evaluates initiatives: the best ideas are
those that solve real customer problems and build long-term loyalty.

## Leadership Style and How He Responds to New Ideas

As a leader, Adam Kitain combines an **entrepreneurial drive** with
pragmatism. New Product Managers working with him can expect a founder
who is enthusiastic about innovation and open to bold ideas -- but also
someone who will challenge the team to **commit, execute, and validate**
those ideas in practice. Adam often advises entrepreneurs not to wait
for permission or perfection: *"Do it! Don't wait until you have the
'perfect idea' because there's no such thing. Just commit to something
and believe in yourself and you'll figure it out,"* he
says[\[30\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=What%20piece%20of%20advice%20would,entrepreneur%20starting%20a%20business%20today).
He brings this bias for action into Intelligems' culture. If a PM
proposes a new feature or long-term initiative, Adam is likely to
encourage giving it a try -- **provided it aligns with the company's
mission and can be tested or iterated**. He is not one to dismiss
creative suggestions outright; in fact, colleagues note that he
appreciates when team members think outside the box or identify new
opportunities (for example, exploring adjacent use cases like content
A/B testing or expanding to other commerce platforms). However, Adam's
support comes with the expectation that the idea will be pursued in a
**data-informed, goal-oriented way**. He will ask penetrating questions
about how the initiative drives value (especially profit or customer
success), and will expect a plan for how to measure its impact. If the
idea is unproven, he might suggest a pilot or A/B test to gather
evidence before a full rollout, reflecting his testing mindset.

Importantly, **Adam values grit and learning from failure**. In his
view, setbacks are part of the journey for any ambitious project. He
identifies *"grit"* as the most important attribute of a successful
founder -- *"there are going to be so many ups and downs, you just have
to bite down and power through,"* Adam
says[\[31\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=founder%3F).
This resilience translates to how he handles new initiatives: if an
experiment doesn't yield the desired result, Adam doesn't respond with
blame or abandonment of the idea. Instead, he focuses on what can be
learned and improved. He has explicitly stated that even when a test or
feature change is not a "winner," it's valuable to analyze why and try
another
approach[\[11\]](https://podtail.com/podcast/honest-ecommerce/bonus-episode-big-swings-vs-small-wins-embracing-t/#:~:text=move,16%3A33%5D%20Assessing%20business%20lifecycle).
As a result, team members find that Adam fosters a **safe-to-fail
environment** -- he will back bold bets as long as they are honest
experiments. He is also a collaborative decision-maker. Having worked
closely with cross-functional teams (from engineering and data to
operations and sales), Adam tends to welcome input and debate. He
partners especially closely with product managers and engineers to
refine ideas. One of his favorite tools is Notion, which he praises for
its intuitive and reliable design, hinting that he values tools and
processes that bring clarity and alignment to the team's
thinking[\[32\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=What%20is%20your%20favorite%20app,and%20in%20your%20personal%20life).
When evaluating a proposal, he listens to the rationale and will often
relate it back to core principles (Is it good for the customer? Does the
data support this? What's the impact on profit?). If those boxes are
ticked, he's willing to champion the initiative up to the executive
level or board. Conversely, if an idea conflicts with Intelligems'
values or strategy -- say, a growth hack that might erode customer trust
or a feature far outside their profit optimization focus -- Adam will
likely push back or ask the proposer to reconsider. He might say
something like, *"How does this help our merchants or fit our vision?"*,
gently steering the team to focus on what matters most.

In summary, **Adam Kitain's leadership style is empowering and
principle-driven**. He thinks long-term (always considering the 1--3
year vision of Intelligems as the dominant profit optimization platform)
and ensures each initiative moves the company closer to that goal. He
responds to new ideas with a balance of excitement and scrutiny: if you
bring him an idea, be prepared for him to get on board -- and then to
challenge you to make it truly successful. By understanding Adam's
mindset -- data-driven, profit-aware, relentlessly customer-centric, and
grounded in *"let's do it and learn"* -- a new PM can effectively tailor
their approach to gain his support. Propose ideas that align with these
values, show the **data and customer benefit**, demonstrate grit in
execution, and you'll find Adam a collaborative ally who will roll up
his sleeves alongside you to turn those ideas into
reality[\[22\]](https://coloradopodcastnetwork.com/podcast/my-biggest-lesson/episode/adam-kitain-be-helpful-why-going-the-extra-mile-always-pays-off#:~:text=,our%20company%20values%20and%20we)[\[30\]](https://www.superangel.blog/p/founder-friday-adam-kitain-and-drew#:~:text=What%20piece%20of%20advice%20would,entrepreneur%20starting%20a%20business%20today).
