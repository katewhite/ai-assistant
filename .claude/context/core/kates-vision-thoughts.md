# Kateâ€™s Vision Thoughts

Type: Vision / Strategy

As Iâ€™ve ramped up with Intelligems, listened to customer calls, and read *all the things* on Drew, Helen, and Adamâ€™s vision thoughts, Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about how to frame and articulate whatâ€™s to come for Intelligems in 2026 and beyond. I donâ€™t think our current vision statement is ambitious enough, or truly communicates the ideas Iâ€™ve heard and seen from everyone. More specifically, â€œprofit growth platform for Shopify brandsâ€ doesnâ€™t encompass the AI-centric thinking weâ€™ve all been doing.

Weâ€™re currently working on foundational feature coverage with experiments and experiences, and starting to break into the AI world we live in. The foundations (profit growth platform) are necessary to continue enabling AI to do all the things we want it to do, but 2026 should be our true AI-first year, **turning Intelligems into our customersâ€™ personal profit growth expert.** 

Most of our customers either struggle with profit optimization on lean teams or hire agencies to do the heavy analytical lifting. Thereâ€™s no reason Intelligems canâ€™t be that expert for them, while leveling up our current agency customers.

There are a few storylines that feel compelling to me:

### 1. The trust-building journey

Starting with "AI suggests, human approves" is critical in the trust-building stages, both given the state of AI in the market and the need for continuing to learn about a business before earning that businessâ€™s trust. I think there's a clear progression where the AI earns more autonomy as it proves itself. You start as helpful advisor, become trusted expert, and eventually become the indispensable business partner. Thereâ€™s incredible power in the stickiness that will come from our AI knowing their business, seasonal patterns, customer behavior, and growth levers better than any external agency ever could.

### 2. Regular reward loops in the flywheel

Hannah called out a customer who mentioned that checking test results "feels a bit like checking a stock app like Robinhood." There's real psychology there when running tests. Each step of our flywheel should deliver a reward (to wherever the customer is: email, Slack, etc) that creates anticipation for the next, and pulls them back into the app:

- **Explore:** "I found 3 profit opportunities worth $X/month."
- **Experiment:** â€œYour experiment has reached 95% confidence with 5% improvement in conversion.â€
- **Experience:** â€œWatch that 5% growth across your entire user-base.â€
- **Back to explore:** â€œYouâ€™ve increased conversion by 5%, while we continue learning from that, thereâ€™s opportunity to increase AOV by focusing on checkout tests.â€

We're creating genuine value moments that keep customers engaged with profit optimization.

### 3. Expand our profit growth surface area (stolen directly from Drew ðŸ˜)

The Intelligems AI agent needs all the tools to work with for complete profit optimization. In the near term, this means expanding the surface area of profit levers we can touch on their site. We don't cover all the areas that drive profit growth yet, so there's huge opportunity to add more interaction modes and decision points where we can help merchants make profitable choices.

Longer-term, this surface area expansion naturally extends beyond the website. When AI shopping through ChatGPT and other platforms becomes dominant, we'll already have the profit intelligence infrastructure to power those experiences, too. Just like a real agency thinks holistically about all customer touchpoints.

## How?

I like Adam's horizons framework, and wondered if it makes sense to frame the horizons around specific goals and outcomes:

### **Horizon 1: Multi-product and tool consolidation**

Outcome metrics: % multi-product accounts, < number of Shopify apps installed (?)

Focus: expand our foundational capabilities and surface area across profit levers. This means checkout optimization, more comprehensive offers, cart functionality, and all the core building blocks that give our AI expert more tools to work with. We become the consolidated platform for profit optimization rather than a collection of point solutions.

### **Horizon 2: Retention and active engagement**

Outcome metrics: retention, weekly active use, sessions impacted

Focus: get merchants using us weekly, impacting more of their sessions consistently. This is where sitewide analytics, AI making proactive suggestions, and notifications outside the product come into play. We're creating those reward loops that keep customers coming back and checking progress. The AI starts to build more trust and feel like a member of their team.

### **Horizon 3: Quality and impact of optimization**

Outcome metrics: profit per visitor

Focus: companies make higher-quality, faster trips through the flywheel. The AI expert is really running the show here, designing better tests, spotting opportunities faster, and getting merchants to profitable outcomes quicker. This is where we move from tool to true business partner.

There's no reason we can't make progress on all three horizons in parallel. Every new profit lever we build gives our AI agent more tools to work with. And as the agent gets smarter about what drives results across our customer base, it can help inform priorities on which levers to build next. This creates a reinforcing loop where better tools create better AI insights, which point us toward even better tools.
