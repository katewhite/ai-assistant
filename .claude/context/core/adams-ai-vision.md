# AK AI Vision

# Intelligems AI Product Vision

## Strategic Direction

The core of the AI strategy is to strengthen our product offering by delivering even more value with less effort required from them.

- Develop AI features that transform from "spiky" testing model to continuous optimization
- Identify AI opportunities across our product pillars that cohere into a broader agentic experience
- Approach development using "bullets not cannonballs" for rapid, iterative development

## AI Opportunity Areas

1. **Test Ideation: Recipes & Recommendations**
    - AI-generated test suggestions based on merchant data
    - Personalized recommendations leveraging 60-80+ onboarding calls
    - Strategic targeting of low-code/no-code users
2. **Test Execution: Implementation & "Vibe Coding"**
    - AI-assisted implementation of tests
    - Reduce technical barriers for merchants
    - Simplify complex modifications with natural language instructions
3. **Data Analysis: Analytics & Insights**
    - Site-wide analytics with AI-powered interpretation
    - Experiment insights and pattern recognition
    - P&L focused analytics with actionable recommendations
4. **Combining #1-3 into a â€˜CRO Agentâ€™**
    - Unified AI agent that combines test ideation, execution, and analysis capabilities
    - Autonomous optimization cycles with human-in-the-loop controls, where the merchant can approve changes or provide feedback/input
    - Contextual awareness of merchant goals, preferences, and historical performance
5. **Dynamic â€œPricingâ€ (discounts, offers, shipping, and prices)**
    - Somewhat orthogonal to the CRO approach, we will build models to help determine expected value and optimize â€œpricingâ€
    - This pricing sub-model can deliver dynamically personalized experiences, delivered by our own proprietary integrations with sites
    - We can also expose an MCP for other agents (like Postscriptâ€™s â€˜Shopper AIâ€™) to access our pricing sub-model

## Why Now

- Models have evololved from "black box" to "gray box" systems
    - Provide visibility into AI decision-making processes
    - Clear rationalization for AI-generated suggestions
    - User controls for review and approval
    - Traceable processes and outcomes for transparency
- Coding and reasoning capabilities of models have improved tremendously in the last 6 months

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Near-term: "Infinity Testing" Concept**
    - Section-specific optimization capabilities
    - AI-generated suggestions with human approval
    - Dynamic reweighting based on performance data
    - Target 75% automation with human oversight
2. **Mid-term: Additional Experience Types**
    - Non-test experiences (bundles, upsells)
    - "Always-on" dynamic features for continuous value
    - Personalization enhancements through AI
3. **Long-term: Automated CRO Agent**
    - End-to-end CRO from ideation through implementation
    - Integrated analysis and recommendation system
    - Learning and optimization across merchant segments

## Integration Strategy

- Focus initially on content/layout testing vs. pricing/discounts
- Maintain broader "auto-CRO" vision while developing parallel workstreams
- Evaluate platform integration options vs. external tool presence
- Balance immediate customer value with long-term strategic positioning
