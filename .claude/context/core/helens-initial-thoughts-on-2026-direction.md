Imagine we owned a gym (IntelliGym!). Our business model is selling memberships. We have high tech equipment (testing tools). Brands come to us to work out on our equipment. A lot of them skip leg day and hate compound movements. They get distracted and run out of motivation, or it’s too hard to figure out some of the equipment. We also randomly double charge them some months and turn off their access fob periodically. Some personal trainers pay us to use our equipment for their clients, but those clients are only as successful as the skill of the trainers allows, and some don’t get good results because the trainers are inexperienced. 

The future: We build an AI personal trainer that assesses a brand’s needs and turns IntelliGym into an operating system for their fitness (profit growth). The AI trainer makes sure they use the right equipment and do the right moves for them consistently. We even add a machine where they can lie down and read a magazine while the machine works their muscles. The trainer keeps them engaged and texts them with new ideas and encouragement. The trainer might even come over to their house to stock their fridge with healthy stuff (interfacing with IG via Slack - or other ecosystem plays). The business model becomes about selling access to the trainer’s expertise and the results generated. Other personal trainers can still bring people to our gym and get ideas from the AI trainer so they can take on even more clients, and their business also grows. Everything at IntelliGym feels bespoke for the brand, like they are the only member, and fundamental systems work flawlessly (we are never out of towels, and we don’t mess up their billing and key fob). 

What would need to be true to…

**Optimize current S-curve (2-3x growth)**

- Near-perfect execution - ship our butts off
- Better retention - product adoption improvements + barrier removal (stop f-ing up the basics)
- Figure out rep headcount equation to produce predictable growth
- Sell consistently to bigger brands (higher ACV and expansion revenue potential)
- Add useful features, but playing within the same pillars we’ve established already

**Create a new S-curve (5x growth)**

- Go all in on AI - automate CRO work - we continuously optimize a brand’s store → “smart store” is the outcome
- Sitewide as a major driver - lean harder into benchmarking and that authority this gives us
- Decisively capture more “means of production” - own a new profit surface area like cart
- Don’t neglect the fundamentals (distribution still matters)

**Big rocks for a new curve:
(not saying this all happens in 2026, but this is how it fits together in my head)**

- AI replaces manual optimization work (H3)
    - Agentic: fully cover off on ideation → implementation → analysis → iteration
    - Brands approve changes rather than doing the work (the manual levers are still there, but we start with smart defaults unless they specifically want to work manually)
    - “Set it and forget it” becomes real
- Platform can control all profit levers (H2)
    - Own the pixels: checkout, offers, shipping, pricing, content, product merchandising (need a better name but basically this is the Because evolution),” invest in an IG CART - cart is a commodity but gaining control of this is very sticky and lets us leverage a lot of what we’ve already built with less friction
    - Better audience control - Klaviyo segment integration, work towards saving custom audiences
    - Dynamic display by tag logic and metadata
    - Sitewide becomes where people start their day (or we send insights right to them), and we intersperse sitewide inisights into other features
    - Enable LLM optimization - why not serve different content to LLM crawlers?
    - We start to enable cross-surface optimization - it’s no longer about just an isolated test, it’s about orchestrating all the different levers we can pull
- Ecosystem play - let brands and agencies build with Intelligems (H2)
    - API
    - MCP server
    - Integration strategy
    - Tech partnerships
- Every day value creation (H1)
    - Clean up UX debt - the underlying mental model and core flows still have to make sense
    - Keep driving adoption of always-on experiences vs. one-off tests
    - Habit formation → insights and triggers
    - Non-negotiable precision: billing
    - Agency and big brand features
        - User management
        - Aggregation across stores
