Transcript:
 
Them: Well, howdy. Well. How's it going? It's going. How are you? Pretty solid. Started snowing here today again. Oh. I wish I never snows in Georgia, does it? It does, but kind of, like, rarely. It's not like, a yearly event. And when it does snow, everyone loses their minds in, like, a bad way. Everything shuts down. And is it like when Texas had that freeze event a couple years ago? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. The worst was probably. I forgot when it was. I think I was in college. I was in. Well, I was in college. I think it was in, like, 2013. The Andrew city shut down. Like, the highways froze over. There were, like, kids in school, buses stuck on the highway. Losing minds. Wow. Well, I'll pray for no snow for Georgia, right? Yeah, exactly. Thank you. What's up? Howdy. Howdy. Howdy. Some smiley faces today. Jerry's smiling. What's going on, Jerry? I was just thinking, Howdy is Carolyn trademark. Trademark. I assimilated this company with my howdies. Yeah. Yeah. I thought Jerry was smiling because he was just looking at the photo. I just thought it was really funny when you were like, wow, I can't believe this is still on the Internet. And then the next day, Alex is like, we've updated our website. Does that Internet. Does that image exist on our new website? Yeah. The image is pulled directly from About Us page, and there's the founder's story. What? You're wondering where I got it. Different photo. Oh, man, it is that photo. Wow. Did not realize Alex. I thought it was like. I don't know, this one looks a little less awkward than just on your desk, but I thought it was like. I mean, there's, like, eight versions of that photo. There is one of us smiling and not mug facing. I thought it'd be funny to do it like serious portrait studio, like one of Drew. But then we put your face like in a vignette up in the corner, coming out of shadow. Oh, man. Threats to Internet. No banana have it. Do the Shakespearian version with the giant frills. Okay. Speaking of nano banana. Hold on here. Excited to go through our 2026 company okrs. Hannah. I think it was on a call with someone, so she's probably running over, but she'll probably be back soon. But I'm gonna get started without her. Maybe before we get started, like a couple team people things Millen. Congrats. Welcome to the squad that happened. And we also made an offer on Monday and was accepted yesterday to Jerrica, who. Not the first time. We made her an offer to join Intelligems, but really excited because she accepted this time and she's going to join Intelligems as a product manager. On the platform and ecosystem side of things, and we'll talk about that in a second, but. All super exciting stuff. Cool. Let me go through. So Drew and I maybe, like, second to stage two. Drew and I spent, like, Well have been thinking about 20, 26 things like the end of October board meeting. And so we. Over the last seven weeks, I guess have done a few different exercises. With different combinations of people, including some of the folks in this room trying to get input on, like, what do we see as the big rocks, the, like, big strategic initiatives, like, where we can actually, like, create an outsized impact on 2026. And I would say over the last few weeks have been really invigorated and excited by the opportunities that are on the table. Really been inspired by some of the thinking from different people, as well as just sort of. Realization that the. The opportunities are sort of taking and. Get into 30, $40 million in revenue in 2026 is like. In the cards, potentially. And so all very exciting stuff. So we used a lot of that input. Like a lot of the excitement, tried to channel it and instructure it into company level okrs. So the first half of this conversation is going to be the like company level OKRs, which are by design all very cross functional, obviously product and like this whole team is driving like what the company does, right? So it's like this is what we build and sell and so like product and tech is going to be very, very. Core to all of the okrs. But as we go through them, you'll see that, like this team alone cannot. Get to many of these okrs, we, like, need to help and support of our go to market partners. And so some of the examples that you'll see in there of both key results as well as, like, initiatives, some of them will skew more products and we'll skew more go to market. Because this is the company okrs. And in the second half of this conversation, we'll talk about how to send, like, translates to team goals and product pillars. And, like, I'm going to ask you guys to do some homework and, like, there'll be some next steps coming out of this. And so. That's what I'm hoping to cover today. I've had more caffeine than usual, so let's go. Slicer mode. Oh, no, it's non slash mode. Okay? Is there a way I can see you guys without seeing my screen? Okay? It's okay. I think if you do. If you do slideshow mode and then you navigate back to Google Meets, you can actually control the slideshow within Google Meets. Oh, interesting. Oh, let's try that. The thing is that the slideshow is on. Yeah. Now, if you alt tab or whatever the Mac equivalent is to the Google Meets, I think it's. You can control the slides natively within the meets itself. I think they have some integration. Maybe. I'm in Google Meets, but whatever. I'm just going to not do slideshow mode. The thing is, is that, like, I have a double wide monitor, and so when I do slideshow mode, it takes a full screen. Okay? Okay. Ours are sort of like one level down from our mission and vision. Just reiterating mission make commerce Intelligems So, like, you'll see a lot of, like, executing on this mission in the, like, Intelligems commerce side of things. Continuous learning, delivering value for buyers and sellers. Adapting to each customer. These are all things that hopefully come out into the okrs. But just restating the mission and vision here as like context, setting. Nothing here. That's new. Okay. 2026 intelligence company. Jeff is. So there are four here. They're not totally different from types of objectives we've had in the past, but again, spent a lot of time thinking on, like, specific language wording here.  
Me: Which.  
Them: Slightly different. So, number one.  
Me: Is.  
Them: Deliver outsized value that requires minimal effort from customers, much of which it delivered while they sleep. So. That first one to me. Really is around, like, creating value for our customers. And maximizing the value effort ratio. So, like, the more value we can deliver, the easier we can make it for them, if we could even do it for them. Without them having to think about it or be involved. That is, like, the objective. Number two, build the Intelligems commerce platform and ecosystem. One of the things that like we are very excited about is like, we have seen agency partners be really good for our go to market motion. They help us reach new customers. They do at marketing for us for free. When they're like, hey, we are a great agency because we use intelligence like, that is free marketing. Can we continue to double down on that and get them to do some of our product development for free and build really cool tools and applications into intelligence, where intelligence is the center of what becomes this Intelligems cars. Ecosystem. Number three. Scale revenue efficiently, predictably and aggressively. There is a lot of opportunity on growth. And. We want to be able to spend more money on marketing and sales and like the whole go to market motion and on the end self serve motion and so making sure that we. Know that how we invest our money. Has a return on it that's like sort of the predictable. That return is efficient and can unlock those two things. We want to be aggressive for that spending. And then number four, hire great people and build systems at scale. If we can achieve these goals. I know this year was, like, we grew from 25 to 65 almost, which was, like, pretty insane. Translating that forward. If we were to be over 100 people next year, we need to make sure that we are hiring great people and holding that high bar and continuing to build the systems and scale. I'm going to go into each one of these in a lot more detail, but any questions so far? If I've done one thing. Well, at the end of this call, you will remember all four of these objectives. So there's going to be a lot of repetition here. And the goal is that you remember all four of our objectives. And also have internalized them. So I'll restate. Objective 1. Deliver outsize value that creates minimal effort from customers, much of which it delivered while they sleep. You know, we talk a lot about. You know, adding value, our customers will mean that we can charge more. It means that they will retain better if we reduce the effort. They will use more. They will like, use more different parts of the product. They will use it more often. They will get more value. Like the. There's so many positive virtuous cycles. By having low effort, high value features. And as I've been talking about this with people like, and I've been reflecting on it, I've had this question in my mind of, like. Is this self serving? Am I like, being a little bit, you know, like. Am I, is my creation of value self serving? And at the end of the day, like, I think the answer is no. Like, the whole point of this is create value for our customers. Like, that is why, like, why we are in business and you're trying to make commerce Intelligems and we are successful if we can create value. So yes, there is like something self serving to like better retention and being able to charge more. However, like at the end of the day, If we like the goal here. Is to create value for our customers. Then, like, the positive impact on our business is that we can charge more and, you know, get better retention from them. So some of the initiatives that I think ladder up to this is like continuing to invest in our core UX AI automation is just make it easier to use our product and get to that value point. So whether that's like early life cycle. Later stage life cycle. Core flows, high value flows, whatever, like, and just this is a very, very obvious product opportunity. Number two. Doing it for our customers. We've had this sort of, like, inclination. We've used the term, like, not stealing our not stealing the confetti or not pushing the button for them, where it's like, hey, we want to, like, push the onus on our customers to use the product. I think we're like, questioning that and rethinking that. Hey, can we actually be like, oh, we see an opportunity to do like. You can get value from intelligence, especially if there's a, like an always on component to that value. We would be happy to press the start button for you and, like, let's take more ownership of your success and your outcomes. And we actually have an Andrew initiative on the like on the agency partnership side, where we are, like, customers are paying intelligence to implement intelligence for them. And we are help, like using agency resources to, to staff that and. And deliver it. So that's a really interesting thing. Sort of like similar vein, but a little bit more of the. Sort of product tech focus is like Intelligems is done for you agentically. Again, like if we can deliver and do intelligence for you. Automated with an agent. That is how you get value without having to put a lot of effort in. And then the other is like increasing our profit surface area. You know, we talked about this all the time. But just more ways to add value, especially the things that you can turn on and leave on to make you more money. That's like sort of this while you sleep concept. And so. Spend a lot of time with Nano Banana and. This is snoopy. He's sleeping. And the intelligence value maker is like creating value for him while he sleeps. So, like, again, just the idea here is. Yeah. I was blown away that there was no patenter or copyright infringement. I got him to do spongebob. I got him to do Mickey Mouse. We liked to be the best. But yeah. Snoopy loves to get value while he's sleeping, and as do our customers. This is like, create. Continuous while you sleep. Value. One. Sort of like talk. I mean, like, I've used the term. We're using it more and more. The concept of a leave behind, like. The idea here is we would be happy to invest in work up front. Like, you see the. The Peanuts crew here, like, figuring out how to, like. Set up and install this machine that is creating value, and then when it's done, it just, like, runs in the background. And, like, creating value. And so if we can, like, Upfront invest in creating value for our customers that has this leave behind that creates value on in an ongoing way. That is a fantastic business model. Many, many large, successful companies have built companies on this business model. And so that's something that we are excited about. So while you sleep, value, continuous value. And just also like reiterating the effort to value ratio and trying to create more value with lower effort. See results. And these are things that we will track as a company. And our goal for the year. We believe that if we can deliver a lot of this value, it will have a tremendous impact on retention. And specifically, the lever that we think that is moving here is the gross retention. So moving gross retention from, say, 89, 90% to 95% or so is a huge improvement. Every year. Retention is our A plus problem. Every year we. Make small, sort of like incremental. Improvements in it. And really see a big opportunity to. To make big improvements. I see those sort of like light in the tunnel and now I'm really excited about this. So that's an outcome that we're really going to shoot for. Another ambitious one. This is very much aligned with our North Star product. Metric is like what's almost double sessions impacted. There is no reason we can't get a majority of our sessions like customer sessions impacted by the end of 2026. This is a lot of work. It means that we need to, like, get people using intelligence more, more always on value, more things living in the background. But I think this is achievable. And like again, if we can double the amount of sessions impacted, that will create a lot more value for our customers. Lead to better retention, lead to better value. I am open to adjusting the number here slightly, but like I put a stake in the ground, I think 75% customers by the end of the year have an active, automated or always on feature. You'll see this show up in our. This is going to replace our third L2 metric. But I think that, like, this is an explicit goal that we want to have, which is, like, more always on value. I had this meeting times of product activated less than seven days. Emily, I think that actually our median customer is product activated in seven days. And so maybe you want to make this even more aggressive. Yeah. Or maybe it's like 75th percentile or 80th percentile. So we can discuss. An adjustment there. And then the last because we're adding more value. We believe that, like growing ACV a mere 40% to $500 a month across our customer base is, is a totally achievable outcome. There's a lot of things that ladder up to this. It's pricing and packaging. It's more mid market. It's more, you know, done for you. Services and agent can ladder into this, but ACVs at $500 a month is, is a stake in the ground. That is Objective one. Any questions on objective one? Do we know what this 75% is currently? And I'm guessing not because it's not a sub bullet, but I'm. I'm curious. I think, I mean, if we were to use any of our experiences metric, I think it's somewhere in the like, it's in the high single digit percentages. It's like, I don't know, 6%, 5%, 8%, something like that.  
Me: So. Yeah. Is your definition of always on an experience? Or is it like it's been on for X amount of time?  
Them: I guess it's. I tell you it's not. It's not. Maybe test and. Yeah. It is. I think it's an experience. There may be other things as we build them. That that fit into this, it's, like, slightly intentionally broad. But. It is. I think we have opportunity to define it exactly. But, yeah, it's basically an experience. Cool. Moving on to Objective 2. Does Anyone remember Objective 2? Please. Don't ask Granola. Platform impress. Platform, Intelligems commerce platform and ecosystem. If we are at the center of the universe. That is a really good saving for intelligence. So. It is a moat. It will help generate growth. Our agency partners already help us generate growth. They are some of our stickiest, highest converting, you know, customers. And the more we continue to build ourselves at the center, that makes it really hard for people. Like, creates more value for our customers. It creates more differentiation for intelligence. And both of those things make it more likely that people want to pay us more money and stick around for longer. So all those things are good. Also Intelligems commerce is like the goal. So we are building the ecosystem. How, number one, exposing the APIs and MCPS and other tools like TDD that enable these agencies and tech companies to build products on top of intelligence and our data, again, that, like, is I think we have the levers, the data, the things that can potentially build really cool products. And we're starting to see that I'm really excited about it. Hence the investment in jerryca. By the way, Sam Duncan is going to be entirely focused on tech partnerships, and this is, like, just a really exciting opportunity. The tech partnership ecosystem that drives retention for our customers, and then a lot of content and, like, best practices. And like skill development around Intelligems commerce. So here is. Here is the platform where we are sort of the middle. Different people are plugging in. This would sort of be like Universe Lens. Another version of this has, like, we have the toolbox and the building blocks that people then can use to, like, build it into. So we want to give people tools and building blocks and see what they build. Key results. Number one. We believe that revenue attributable to partners, both agency partners and tech partners, which is like, set somewhat net new. Oh, sorry. Oh, yeah, no, don't worry about it. I personally said you covered it. I was like, I was trying to figure out what you glazed over and then I backwards and comments. Sorry. All good. 40% of revenue attributable to partners. Basically, just like. Is our partner ecosystem growing and thriving. Is basically that first key result. And I think that if 40% up from, say, 30, 35% today, would be a really strong signal that that ecosystem is growing and thriving. This is a really, like, this is. Maybe this is understated. I think this should be higher. But 20% of customers are using an ecosystem solution built on intelligence APIs. In other words, Are we seeing API calls through our like, partner APIs for 20% of our customers? Are people using a tool that is built by someone else? I think that that would be a really strong indication that like, we have done a good job enabling people to build valuable tools which again in turn serves creates value for our customers. 25% of customers launch an experience using a content driven template, guide or workflow. Tbv on how we measure this. But there's, like, a lot of really interesting ideas around, like, hey. Here is like what you can go build in Intelligems. Like, click this link, it goes and, like, template ready to go. We can, like, attribute the content to that. Stuff again, making it easier. For people to use and like showing that our content is creating value for people. And median intelligence customer has two plus tech integrations turned on, meaning. The second bullet here, this was about, like, other people building on it to intelligence. And here, this is about Intelligems pushing and pulling. To the ecosystem. So, like, it might be slack, ga, et cetera. Like, people are using Intelligems integrations broadly. Questions on. Objective2. Adam. On the second bullet is that that number is at 0% or like half percent or something like that. Yeah, it would be zero. Okay, okay. This is 0 to 20 in 2026. I should use more 26s in my. In my. Okay, this should be 26% of customers. I say mythical for 2026 was 26 million anyway. Objective3. Scale revenue efficiently, predictably and aggressively. I think, like. This is a, an obvious business objective. It is a little bit more internal looking than like customer facing looking. But I think that. These are all this is a really important objective for our business, to be able to continue to, like, fund itself and grow and be healthy and so. One of the ideas here is like, Minimizing go to market drag, which is a concept that Emily introduced into into our thinking, which means, like, When someone installs intelligence, we have a solution for them. If we don't have a solution for them, we have wasted a bunch of time and money and ever getting them into install intelligence in the first place and so making sure that like we can serve. Our market that we are, like, getting to find and use intelligence. Doubling down on promising growth avenues. So it's like, hey, what is working? Where are we finding people? Is it in these, like, you know, events? Is it in our profit propagandists? How are we getting people to find and install Intelligems and double down on those things? And, you know, the more we can feel confident, that's the, like, predictable part and efficient part, that a dollar in is a dollar out. The more we feel like we can invest into it, and the more we feel like we can invest into it, the more an investor is going to want to feel like they can invest. Into it, and that's obviously good all around, so. How can we scale revenue efficiently, predictively and aggressively? Number one? And again, these are all just examples. I'm sure there's, like, a million things that we could do here. Eliminate first quarter churn. This is, goes to efficiency. It is like a big waste of time and effort and money to, like, spend a lot of time closing a deal and having them go through onboarding and integration just for them to, to churn in in two months. We believe that we can improve that significantly, and there's a lot of efforts to do so. Number two, This is around product LEDs. It's the same idea, just not sales like the product led. Three is around the same like concept of the go to market drag market leading capabilities that work for brands of all sizes. For events like that's come up a lot in the go to market conversations where it's like, hey, we should be doing more events. We should be showing up keynote speakers, things, you know, hosting roundtables, et cetera, and have like a more structured events. Events. Strategy. I'm going to fly through this. This just uses a little bit more good market focused, but yeah. Growth trajectory. Exit velocity is the term I was looking for. This is Drew's idea. That, like, Rube Goldberg machine. So it's like, hey, we're putting all this. But it. But in the. In the, like, comics, the pipes, it's like, hey, like, we're pouring all of this water into the funnel. And like. If we can fix the leaks along the way, the wheel at the end of the funnel, at the end of this system, which is the like our revenue like that will spin faster and, and more powerfully if we can fix all the leaks. And if we fix all the leaks, then pour in more water in is like more water out at the end. And so, you know, let's just, like, really focus on. Go to market and like, and the efficiency of making sure that the customers require. Continue to get value from us. So this is just a little bit of, like, growth targets. Some of these are being figured out at the moment by Ken, Ben, et cetera. 6,000 active customers. That's about 160% growth. I think that that's achievable, especially if we make improvements to retention and we increase our, like, partner funnels. Like, no reason we can't have 6,000 active customers. And as Ben and Kim are modeling this out, like, very, very achievable. 70% of qualified leads. Regardless of channel turn into paying customers. So like they come through sales, they come through cold install. Can we get 70% of installs to paying customers? And when you you may think yes or no. I'd love to revisit this number with you and figure out what makes sense for the product led. But like that was our stake in the ground. Working upwards from there, then, like, okay, if we want to get to 6,000 customers and we think we can convert 70% of them, like, what is the amount of pipeline we need to generate? And like, what is that? Then, like, turn into. For. For marketing. And a big lever here. And this goes to efficiency is 90%. Retention in the first 90 days. That Emily was your own independent key result that I saw. And that is, by the way, across channel and across. Sorry, across the file. So sales led, partner led, self led. This is the goal here. And. And I think very achievable. Adam, that number or Emily is like, what, 20, 25%? Ish. 70% in brackets. No, the 90% first 90 days gross retention. Oh, no. If we're talking, I think you would talk gross retention from, like, paying custom. Like, first pay, you become a paying customer. And how long do you retain? Yeah, and that's, that's like, I have it. It's later in a slide, but that's. Like, for core, it's like 75 and that, so there's, like, definite room for improvement. But then the 70% or whatever that number is in brackets, that's, like, from install or, like, demo to becoming a paying customer. So it's like that part and then that part. All right. I am perfectly on schedule. Let's continue. And Objective 4. And this is not just sort of like a box checking exercise, like, It is fourth, but not last. Really, really mean this. Hire great people and build systems at scale. Like are people or company it is. How we will be successful. It is one of our greatest. It is our singular greatest asset and continues to be why we are so bullish. On being able to achieve these targets. We need to keep the bar high. Because if we don't, that will. Will completely derail the whole thing. So there is an important around recruiting, there is an important concept here around sticking to these OKRs, by the way, like part of the not just about the people, but also about the systems. We are. Very good. Not very good. We have made OKRs in the past. We do not always follow through on them and track them. One of my goals and Drew's goals is to be better about being oriented around goals and outcomes. I believe that this is going to continue to get better. I think that also having this whole group of people here that can be accountable for subsets of these objectives and key results, and that we'll get to that when we get to the homework piece. But each of each product pillar having key results that they are striving for that ladder up to these key results, I think, are a big part of how we. Build systems. That make us all align working on the same towards the same star. And leveraging data internally like one of the big. Step changes I've seen this team do a lot better in this year is like leveraging data. Whether it's mixed panel, whether it's, you know, replays, whether it's, you know, sort of the usage data in our database. Using data to help us make better decisions and track how we're doing against our. Our outcomes. So here's the peanut gallery. The peanut gallery. All working together and building systems that scale. Okay, like key results here are like Speed of job posting to offer accepted. Achieve 70% of our okrs. I don't even know why this is in brackets. This should not be in brackets. 100% of new hires meet or exceed expectations, and 100% of employees use one AI tool as a core part of their daily workflow. So. That is objective four. Before I move on to the product. Orientation of this. Any questions about our okrs. This is the last Nano banana. Illustration. Cool. I had it. Maybe one question from the last bullet of the last slide about the AI tool use. Like, I feel like we use AI pretty frequently. Is it this on here because you feel like. Like the product and engineering teams collectively should be leaning in more? Or is it that maybe other parts of the org are not, as Kevin adopted. These tools. As much as we have, or a bit of both. I'm going to. Sidestep that question and say that Drew put this bullet here. And I think that we do a great job of adopting AI But I'm sure there's always room for improvement. And I don't want to say that the rest of the organization is not doing this, because I think they probably are, too. But I think it's more just like, hey. Are we being as productive and, you know, leveraging the tools at our disposal that can even I yesterday actually. Wrap this. One of the thoughts that I had halfway through is like, I am so excited to ask Granola for feedback about how I presented these okrs. And, like, I feel like I use Granola as a note taker. And yesterday I asked it for feedback, and it's feedback was, like, so freaking good. And, like, I could be using Granola as a coach, which is a way higher value leverage, like, use of Granola than as a notetaker, and so. I don't know. I imagine that. We can all get more leverage and value out of AI tooling. So that's just. I think that's why that's there. Adam on the, on the new hires and join the team. Sarah and I were talking about this a little bit in LA and, like, opportunistic hires versus, like, roles were actually hiring for. If we have, like, one or two people in our network, and I'm sure everybody does, who's, like, we got to figure out a way to, like, get them to join the team. Like, how do we think about that? Of, yeah. Yes, we probably don't normalize process or need one, but. Yeah, how do we think about that generally? Yeah. It's, I would say, like. Drew and I more so than most. And actually, many of the people in this call were opportunistic hires like and Drew and I believe in hiring great people and taking advantage of that when that moment arises. I also think. Depending on where we are in budgeting and planning and cycles like we also there needs to be a role for them. We are at a scale where there are, like, Probably a number of roles that we are actively hiring for. A number of roles that we are not actively hiring for, but no would be, like, valuable and then, like, Other roles that are not on the docket for now. And so, like, between that first and second category, they probably have a fit. And so I would say generally open to opportunistic hires and like, You know, if you guys know great people, great people are great. Yeah. Yeah. Or shane like. If you have. If there's someone in mind, like, or not just you, Shane. Like anyone. If you have someone in mind that you're like, hey, this person is awesome. Their company is like, lame people off and they want a job. What type of conversation about it and figure out what might be a good fit for them. And instead of having, like, a list of roles and we like, do they slide into any of these, we just, like, figure out, is there an intersection of, like, what this person wants to do and what, what we have? Potentially a need for. Cool. Product pillars. We did product fillers this year. I think it worked well. I'm, like, continuing to be excited about, like, ownership and product pillars as a way of creating, like, the lanes that we can run in. Product pillars are not meant to be, like, bright line differentiation between parts of our product. They are meant to be, like, Outcome and objective oriented, strategic. Areas that we believe we want to invest in in order to achieve these goals. And so, like, Again, the idea is not for this to be a perfectly niecy structure. The idea is for us to be able to create areas of ownership and. All of us working on things that we believe are high leverage that ladder up to our key results. So, anything else I wanted to say about Product Alert before I flipped to the next side? And maybe, like, one other thing I was going to say is. I think that these pillars have a long time of Runway. Like a year and potentially longer to them. That doesn't mean that in three months we don't add a pillar or split a pillar or merge a pillar or reframe a pillar. So, like, the idea behind these pillars is there is a lot of Runway behind them. It's not just for Q1. At the same time. I don't want to. This is not locking for eternity, I hope. People who've been here long enough have seen lots of changes, and so I think that that's worth calling out. Okay? In no particular order. Core experience is a pillar. These are like, I'm rebranding pillars. In some ways, core experience is like, how do people use intelligence and understand our value? This is. Examples of initiatives and big rocks. Beneath this is like test and experience, creation and editing. You know? How do we incorporate this component design and building into our product? Base, what people are here to do. How do we get them to use intelligence? Get value from it and understand that value. Number two is profit lovers. This is like, how can we deliver more value to our customers? Some of this are things that we have today. And like, Have only scratched the surface. Of the distribution and value creation that we believe that we can achieve. I continue to believe that this has. A tremendous amount of headroom. Kaching as a company. Is as big as we are. Rebuy is five or six times larger. We can profit levers is that and so much more. I think we can grow so much by investing into the profit levers. Pillar. Growth. As a pillar. A third of our revenue is product led. And that is so much inefficiency in that funnel where so many opportunities that Emily is identifying and like, excited to continue to invest in. So I want to call out especially first mile. That may be a focus for only a shorter term. I think the like long term goal here. Around growth like over the course of years is activation, adoption and engagement, which is a lot of life cycle. In it. I think that, like, there is a tremendous amount of value in the first mile. So whether that focus is like 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 TBD. But. But that's where I see this pillar. Adding a lot of value. Insights as a pillar. Like, how do we know? How do people know what to do? And if what they're doing is achieving value and what they should be doing next. I think that, like this is a obvious opportunity. Like, we are an Insights company. We are selling insights. We are selling Intelligems commerce. Like you can't do Intelligems commerce without insights. And then ecosystem, which is like, how people build on top of intelligence. How do we enable our agencies? How do we enable our tech partners? How do we, like, put intelligence at the center of this universe? And lastly, agentic. This is like. Relatively. In its infancy as a pillar. But, you know, we talk about Andrew and his new role, getting the value of intelligence more automatically done for you. A lot to go figure out of, like, what exactly is the. The scope of work to be done here, But I'm excited that, like, To to run at this 100%. And before I go into the next slide, any questions about pillars here? Feel free to read this, digest it, think about it, ask questions. Let's talk more about this. But I am pumped. Putting names and owners to two pillars. So each one of these pillars has a, like, product owner. A tech team lead and a design. Like lead, so. I'm going to ask the product owners. We'll get to this in a second, but I'm going to ask the product owners the first set of names. And for Jerrica, I will do hers for her. Or maybe Helen, you can help me. Though you and I can do Jerry's for her. Put together the framing of the objectives and key results for the pillar. Think about what are the initiatives? And the outcomes that we hope to achieve in Q1 and in 2026 for this pillar. Work with Carolyn Christian and your design, you know, counterparts to figure out, like, get their input. They are your partner in crime here. And. And like, these teams of, like, these trios. Try tripods. These trios. Will be the team that is responsible for creating the outcomes. For the pillar. In terms of. All of us together. What do I believe our goals are in addition to the company goals? Still would love to orient ourselves around this L1, L2, L3 framework. The only change that I made I still believe that L1 sessions impacted is our North Star. We have a really ambitious goal to double our impacted sessions by the end of the year. That is, I think, a really, really closely tied to the value we deliver to our customers. The inputs to sessions impacted our active merchants. Like, can we get people. Getting value from intelligence. We know that today 60% or so of merchants are active in any given month. Let's bump that. I think I should probably put goals here, but I think, like, there's a lot of headroom there. Cross product adoption, which means two out of large number of products. Like people use such a small sliver. This like sits around in 15% or 10%. Like crazy amount of opportunity in headroom there. And then number three, which is the new L2 metric. Always on feature adoption. And I believe that, like, That is really if we get people to use the always on products that will drive sessions impacted. Simple enough. And then below that are a laundry list of. Adoption and usage metrics in the product that. Show the things that we are building are being picked up or not and, and used and working towards these, these L2 and L1 metrics. So your homework. I think you can think about this both on the 2026 framing. My main ask is for you to think about this in in the Q1 framing. But I. It's hard. I think that it would be. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't think about it in the context of the whole year. But for Q1, what is your pillar's objective? What is the mission of your pillar? What? Are two to four key results. That you are striving to achieve. In q1. These should be tied to your team's objective admission. So your objective admission is good if the key results align to it. Your key results should also align to the company's key results. If they don't relate to the company's key results, you're probably missing the mark. And they should be hard to achieve. You do not win by hitting all your key results. You win by being ambitious. And trying really hard and getting really close to those key results. And then your L3s. This should be a long list of metrics that you can track to measure outcomes on a more direct impact short term basis. Meaning like you ship a feature, like, are people using it, are people picking it up? It may be some time until that affects whether they are active or number of sessions impacted, but you can tell are they like at least using that feature. So I am putting Emily on the spot. Emily did the homework before I even asked her to, and so I'm using Emily's growth pillar as an example. Emily and I still have a turn maybe to take on this. So this is not. Written in stone. But I thought it was a really good example to share with the team. Maybe. Emily, I'll let you share yours because you wrote this all. Yeah. So I think in particular this is scoped to like Q1 20, 26. So I didn't an exercise for longer term for growth. But then this is for Q1 and so for Q1. If I were to scope it, kind of narrow it, it would be meaningfully, the objective would be meaningfully improve early life cycle success for self serve ICP customers. So and this is like, this is where what Adam and I kind of talked about the narrowing, like early life cycle. So that like first mile is Helen calls it. And then like the customer segment, which is self serve and icp. And then. Key results would be kind of where in the early life cycle, like what outcomes, like what business outcomes or business results can we achieve from like focusing there in our objective? And those in particular are increasing trial to pig conversion for ICP installs trialing from 30 to 35% to 50%. So like we're moving. I first scoped this to core, but if we add plus, it's lower than 30 to 35. So, like, that is a pretty, like, big jump that we would be looking to, looking to achieve there, but important again. And then the second one is like the second part of that funnel. So, like, after you become a paying customer. Can we retain you for 90 days and can we retain you at 90%? Our our current 90 day retention is much lower for that for core at 78 for plus it would be slightly lower than that. So like 90% is a really like good high goal, I think. Helen, one of your comments was you should focus on gross customer retention rather than net dollar retention for Q1. So I think that will be one of the turns that I will take. On this, on these metrics, which makes sense. Like, we don't want these customers to turn. We're less focused on upselling them right now in the first 90 days. And then the key result, three, which is what Adam and I talked about earlier this week, which I think is really, really important, is that we're also driving cross product adoption. Within the early life cycle, which we're not doing at all right now, from the deep dive that I did, which was, like, very, very interesting to me, and, like, a clear area for us to focus on. And then there's like, a bunch of metrics. Like some of them. You guys have seen me talk about these. Some of these here in the L3s. And there are more that we can add. To this list. So my ask and I'll drop this link in the channel is. Product Pillar owners. You are the one responsible. Please get input and alignment with your tech leads and design lead counterparts. But my ask is for the pillar owners on the product side to put together. Your objective key results and L3s. Maybe a version. By midday Monday that I can provide input and feedback on. So that way we can try and finalize them by our product metrics. Check in on Wednesday. The L3s, by the way. I expect to. Be dynamic and fluid. And we add L3s, we may start stop tracking certain L3s. So the L3s are evolving. And, like, not set in stone. I would like the objective and the key results to be something that we track on a bi weekly basis and that product metrics check in. For the quarter. And to the extent there are L3s that substantiate, we want to track against those. Those also we can can track as well. And what I will do is for these six pillars. Roughly 20 or so. Key results. They will then go into a spreadsheet. That also have all the go to market and support and success teams. Krs. So we have a. I will have a spreadsheet where we are tracking the company level. Okay. Like key results. And then each, like, organizational unit is going to have key results, and we will track those, and that's how we will, like, operationalize. This. So once you share it with me and we track it, I will also track it in our company wide key results tracker. Wow. 61 minutes on the nose. I am pumped. Feel free to ask me questions or DM me. And. Rate on this. But yeah, I will share this link now and I will talk to you all. Very soon. Wow. Custom emojis. Go, Jerry. See you later, guys.
