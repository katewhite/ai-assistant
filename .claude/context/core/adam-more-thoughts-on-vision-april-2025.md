# More thoughts on Vision

I still believe in our current mission and vision:

**Mission** - Our mission is to help e-commerce entrepreneurs improve their businesses and make more money.

**Vision** - ****We will do this by making an impact on every single ecommerce shopping session to generate the highest value for that visitor.

Let’s get a bit more specific.

In order to positively impact the site, there are these three phases that are recursive in nature:

1. **Explore** - Intelligems will help merchants learn and understand their users both in aggregate and deeply on an individual level.
2. **Experiment -** Intelligems can build on the learnings of data through experimentation, an even more precise and measurable form of understanding and learning.
3. **Execute** - With the power of data, we can then build the most optimal experience for the visitor.

And I think a reasonable illustration (by no means exhaustive or perfect) of that vision across different [horizons](https://www.notion.so/Shoptalk-DTSki-In-person-reflections-1cd2b372209280aeb78ff28fb3500069?pvs=21):

**Horizon 1** - We build sitewide analytics as the core of the “Explore” pillar. Merchants can better understand opportunities by which to go experiment. We make it easier for merchants to test and build onsite experiences. Merchants deliver more efficient discounts and offers through Intelligems because we have great targeting, make setting those up incredibly easy, and have great analytics to understand their efficacy. Merchants without technical savviness or developers to lean on can get a lot of value from our product easily.

**Horizon 2** - We’re automatically identifying new opportunities for merchants. You don’t need to be analytically savvy to know what the opportunities are and to execute on them — we largely automate much of that away. Building layers of unique and targeted experiences is so seamless even the smallest, most lean merchants are using Intelligems to spin up new onsite experiences and offers. The largest merchants are all coming to Intelligems to orchestrate and execute the intersection of marketing and site experiences, where all offers and experiences are managed in one place.

**Horizon 3** - AI and Intelligems models are replacing the work of marketers and developers to generate personalized site experiences that are completely unique and tailored to each visitor. Discounts, offers, and experiences are completely unique and delivered through a fully integrated personalization engine that lives onsite but extends into all your customer touch points from SMS to digital ads.
