Fall 2025


>>Angel Austin	00:00
Everything's scary right now. Like we nightmare before Christmas. My husband I hate that movie. It's super creepy. Oh no. He just loves it. I need a photo of this costume. I need a photo of this costume. I'm so excited. She's like the perfect age for boo too.

>>Hannah Patterson	00:20
So I love that movie as a kid.

>>Angel Austin	00:25
It's so good. It's so good.

>>Shane Roach	00:28
I gotta watch it this weekend because I went to start it with my kids and I was like, is this gonna be scary? And I like, cause I haven't seen it in a while. I know I like it, but I'm like, I better double check. But if you're a two year old, okay. I'm gonna screen it this weekend.

>>Hannah Patterson	00:41
I feel like I was a scaredy cat as a child, especially when going to bed. Like the dark was just too much for me. And I don't know that I could have done that movie that young. I wouldn't recommend.

>>Craig Phillips	00:54
You're almost too young to be scared. Like you're kind of, you don't know enough to be scared. Don't watch the university one.

>>Angel Austin	01:01
It's like dropping out of school propaganda. So I just would not even show you that to be honest.

>>Shane Roach	01:08
Oh, that's great. Okay. So I think the goal of this session, I haven't joined any of the others, but basically Craig asked me to talk through a little bit more of like my previous role, at Rumple and how I operated in the role and how I thought about tools and what was important to me and tools and workflows and what were the conversations that I was having with leadership and my team. So I'm going to go through that lens and I'll screen share kind of where's relevant, but I think the goal, I just want to talk through it a little bit and give you guys a little bit more context. I think everybody knows that. I used to run e -com for a small brand, but I also want to like share numbers and give you some context as Emily, especially this will be relevant on like where we Rumple fell into like our customer base. So we started using Intelligems, I think in 2023, 2022, I'll have to look back, But like we were an early like first 50 customers, I think. The reason we started using Intelligems was like there was a business need. We were thinking about raising prices because our margins were getting compressed. So like we needed to go into the market and do price testing. Our VP of ops met Adam at a bar in Boulder, just like randomly. And that's how we became a customer early, which was awesome. And so that's why we started using Intelligems.

>>Shane Roach	02:51
So at the time, like did a little bit of shopping around, but it was just an early product and we needed to price test. The business was doing about 10 million in revenue on the website. So I can't remember what our average like Gmv of our customer is right now, but do you know that Emily, or does anyone know what our average is or our median? I don't know. I'm guessing it's 10 to 20. Anne, do you have any idea? I don't know. We have so many, our average is probably lower, but our median I bet is higher. So the team, I think this is also like helpful context as we're thinking about like decision -making. I think that what I want to really talk about is like path to value of the product and like, where do I see the value and like the ROI was super important to me. So the company was about 40 employees. The leadership team was, let's say six people, head of finance, head of ops, CEO, head of product, head of marketing, head of e -com. And we all had our P &ls And we had our different line items for software. And like we know, and everyone knows that your software probably gets evaluated in Q4 and you're setting budgets for next year. And like, what are we going to spend? And are we going to re -up? Are we going to switch tools? Are we going to sign an annual? Are we going to sign a monthly contract? All of those things. So we came to Intelligems with a problem. We needed to determine can we increase our margins by increasing pricing?

>>Shane Roach	04:34
Rumpel as a business also was like 50 % wholesale, 50 % direct. And of the direct, I think it was about 10 million rumpel .com and let's say three to 4 million on Amazon. So the margins are different on Amazon as well. But wholesale, the way...

>>Shane Roach	04:58
Wholesale Works, broadly speaking, for your average brand, not in the luxury space. Luxury is a different business, but it's like a 4X markup. This is a pretty blanket, but especially in the outdoor, it's literally a 4X markup. It's called Keystone Pricing. That is the term. So The Rumpel Blanket was made for $25. It wasn't, it was less than that, it was like $25 on average. We sold it to Rei for $50. Rei sold it for $100. So Rei sold it for $100. We sold it for $100. And we wanted to find a way to increase margins. And in turn, when you increase margins on the brand side, like say we increased it to $120, you would then sell it to Rei for $60. And then Rei would then sell it for $120. So like, the margin goes across the board on wholesale. So coming to Intelligems, we wanted to test pricing. That was the immediate thing. And like, that's the reason we came to Intelligems. And that's what we wanted to validate really quickly is, can we increase prices? How does that impact? Before even signing up for Intelligems, we just did a lot of modeling like in Google Sheets. It's just like, okay, let's just put some assumptions in. Like if we increase prices, what's going to happen to conversion rates, we think, and where is this actually going to impact the business on a profit basis? So we did pay attention to Cogs. One thing that's great about Intelligems, which we know this, and Hannah, I watched through all the demos that you shared yesterday, so that was super helpful, is the Cogs piece is enormous.

>>Shane Roach	06:47
Like 39 % of our customers have Cogs uploaded. At some point, it doesn't necessarily mean they have the most up -to -date COGS. But as we continually say profit growth platform and profit, profit, profit, and we're saying that's really part of our brand positioning and differentiator with other tools, or just not growing top line, that's our main thesis is profit. With the launch of Sitewide and some of these other nudges, getting Cogs in just seems like such an imperative thing for me. For me, I uploaded them quickly because I wanted to have you guys do all the reporting for me, right? So I didn't, I could just send it to finance, like these are the results.

>>Hannah Patterson	07:34
But I think like - Did you guys have Cogs in Shopify, out of curiosity, or did you like, I mean, I think at the time that you did it, we probably didn't have the hookup, so you had to do the upload, but you had them in Shopify. No, great question.

>>Shane Roach	07:47
I don't think we did, but I think after Hannah, we did add them. And now Shopify has advanced so much that there is a lot of margin stuff on the product level that you can view in Shopify, which is great. They even have that margin column. But no, I think we did the Csv upload. And for us, just to give extra context, a $25 million brand, 40 employees, my request, if I didn't know the Cogs, was like, let me ask the inventory planner, or let me ask the head of product. So pretty easy to get.

>>Hannah Patterson	08:25
And did your Cogs vary a ton from product to product, or was there a pretty consistent percentage? Was it typically 10 % across the board or whatever the number was? Yeah, good question.

>>Shane Roach	08:35
So we had... I wonder if we stored it. We stored it on a SKU level, or like a very, yeah, SKU level. So it was easy to do it at a SKU level. I think one of the tours you showed, Hannah, was like, some brands also just have like, they know their blended margin across all Cogs. So like, if they put the 80 % or whatever, that could give them pretty directional versus exact. So that was a good reference. But no, I just got a Csv from inventory or planning. They gave it to me and I uploaded it. Merchandisers will know Cogs. I get enormous brands. Cogs should not be that hard to get. They might live in Netsuite. They might live with finance and Excel file. They might live in Backbone, the Plm planner. I'm hammering that, I don't know, we got to figure out a way to get Cogs in more accounts. We need to get our Cogs rate to like 80 % or something like that. I don't know. It seems like there's just so much stickier when I can see actually the profit per visitor on charts. But Emily, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm just saying from my point of view, I'm pretending I still work at Rumpel.

>>Hannah Patterson	09:53
Do you think it's legal if we know that

>>Hannah Patterson	09:57
If they have Cogs and Shopify for us to just turn that on? Or is there like legal concerns there?

>>Shane Roach	10:05
Yeah, why can't we do that? No, I mean, I don't see. Maybe we don't add it to like our permissions.

>>Hannah Patterson	10:09
I don't know.

>>Shane Roach	10:10
Yeah, we probably have the permissions, right?

>>Hannah Patterson	10:14
We have the permissions to get that information because if they enable it, we get it. Yeah. I don't know, that feels a little sensitive to me, but I could be overthinking it. I'm no lawyer.

>>Shane Roach	10:26
I don't know, but it seems like... So Cogs is a big thing. So back to the why, it was like, I wanted to test pricing, wanted to know what was the actual impact on the profit side. And then knowing downstream revenue, profit per visitor, that kind of stuff. Because we know conversion's gonna probably drop, right? Or you can assume that. That's a big assumption you make when you do price testing. Then we basically came in like any other customer and was like, all right, we did price testing. We learned from that. And we, this is also classic. We should not have raised prices, but the CEO decided, well, we have to raise prices. And we said, okay, but like the model that we built in Google Sheets says this is a bad idea. The test we literally ran said this is a bad idea, but we're still gonna do it. So I think like as we do onboardings and talk about stakeholders and like literally through the sales process and customer onboarding is like, get your stakeholders aligned on like, what are the goals of this program? Like, why are you coming to Intelligems? And like, let's help shepherd them through like, what are the goals here? But knowing that you can share results, like this Ai summary is good. I think like how we surface results is really important too. Like once a test is done, because maybe it moves up the chain to like the head of e -comm or maybe the head of e -comm then puts it in there, update to the CEO. Like, I think how we phrase a lot of the results is good and the Ai summary helps a lot. So then after that test was done, it was like, well, what's the next biggest lever?

>>Shane Roach	12:07
And Intelligems at the time was like, price testing and shipping testing. It's like, great. Well, let's go into shipping testing. Like we had a hero product or a couple of hero products. We did a couple of price tests. Now let's move into shipping. We always had a free shipping over $49. Guess what? Like 88 % of orders were only over $49. So like effectively who cared? We could just do free shipping on all orders. Like there was not, it didn't really impact the business if we did that. And so we ran a test and like kept the threshold the same because zero versus 49 was effectively the same or sorry, we might've changed it to zero. Then the next thing was all about shipping messaging. So like, is anyone here familiar with the idea of like SharePost or SmartPost? Have you guys heard that term before? Fedex, Smartpost or UPS SharePost? Hannah, do you want to explain it? It's okay. It's not like you're wrong.

>>Hannah Patterson	13:11
I've just seen it when setting up shipping tests but I don't actually know what it is. Okay. Is it like shipping insurance?

>>Shane Roach	13:17
No, no, no. So like if you're a brand And you're a logistics side you can ship it via Fedex or you can ship it via UPS or you can ship it via Usps. Bootleg drop shippers like use Dhl because it's cheap and low and slow. But how you're shipping it is probably due to your contract with your 3PL. It's like my 3PL is a Fedex 3PL or my 3PL is a UPS. Both UPS and Fedex have these products called Sharepost and SmartPost. And what that means is it ships ground to the city But then Usps does final delivery. And so it ships from the warehouse on a UPS plane to Spokane, Washington to the post office, not to the UPS facility. And then the post office does final delivery. And what that allows is it allows you to reduce costs by like 10 to 15 % on the shipper side But it adds like one to two days in delivery to the end customer. And so it saves you money but like does that impact customer experience if I get it in six days instead of four days? And so we tested the messaging at checkout, like, hey, free is like four to six business days and we shipped everything via SharePost the lower and slower method. Or if you want it in like two to four days which is ground, you could pay $10. And so we saw that going a slower rate or I think we said like six to eight business days didn't impact conversion in any way. And it allowed us to save like 15%.

>>Shane Roach	14:56
On a majority of our shipments. So that was like a big other dollar unlock. It was like, cool, let's ship everything via Shorecoast. We used to do ground, we used to do Fedex or UPS ground. It was like $12 an order. Now it's $9 an order. We just saved three bucks on every shipment and it didn't impact conversion. So similarly to how we, years later, talk to customers is we talk about pricing tests, huge swing, right, on your Hero product. We talk about shipping tests as another big swing because it's the biggest cost, it's a huge lever. We talk about shipping pricing tests, but we also talk about free shipping thresholds. We know setting up a shipping test is incredibly complicated so everyone knows. I'll pull that up in a second, Angela, or Angel, sorry. But we see in the results that shipping tests are like less than 10 % of our tests. It's like 3 % of our tests or something like that.

>>Emily Brown	15:59
Yeah, tiny.

>>Shane Roach	16:00
Yeah, and it's like 1 % of Sessions Impact. But we say externally and we know that this is actually an enormous swing for a brand. They might do one to three shipping tests because they're gonna do price testing and then maybe messaging and then threshold or multiple thresholds, you can do a ton. But that seems like, if we can get people into shipping tests, this is just getting to the ROI piece. At the end of the year, at the end of the quarter, the end of the month when your finance team says, hey, Big Shane, are you using Intelligems? What are we getting out of that? They're gonna say, are we using this? Are we still using this? We have episodic use cases. People come to test and then they leave. So the answer probably, if they're on the monthly plan or a six -month plan with finance, ask them every quarter or every month or every six months, are you still using this? The head of e -comm or whoever's in charge might go back and be like, we haven't launched a test in two months, but I do wanna launch a test in a month, so I'm gonna keep it on. Or it's like, no, we haven't, and maybe we have an experience live, but it's whatever, and so they cancel it. Or where we want to get is me as the owner of The P &l and have this as a cost item on my P &l is like, yeah, we use it, and we've used it a few times, but the ROI has been 10X. So we might not be using it this month, but I have some ideas to use it in the next two months to increase that ROI. And so I've asked this a few times, and I know we used to do this, Hannah, so maybe you can share some perspective, but we used to really share what was the impact, and we used to have this ROI front and center.

>>Shane Roach	17:46
We don't anymore because of variants and results and how far we forecast the impact, but if I, as an operator, could answer what is the ROI or my finance person is telling me, you need to cut costs, you need to cut 30 % of your SaaS spend, even me evaluating my vendors, I'd be like, well, s***, I mean, I got 5X the spend here, and these other ones are 2X or 3X. I wanna keep this tool because I can immediately see the dollars it's generating. I think that would be an enormous, I don't know how we solve for that, but as someone who's going through your costs, an example that is a very hated brand in the space, but has been changing its graces in the last 12 months is Yotpo. So does everyone here know what Yotpo is? Or does anyone here not know what Yotpo is? Angel? Angela? Okay, so Yotpo is like the premier product review, like premier plus earliest product reviews app software. So to get product reviews on your Pdp. Then they went into loyalty as well, and we're talking 10 years ago, they were the pioneer. They've raised a s*** ton of money. They went like super heavy into like enormous contract sizes like very heavy sales motion, very heavy success motion, all of that. And now the review space has totally changed. But every year when we would review Yotpo, it's like, should we have a loyalty program?

>>Shane Roach	19:29
Does this make sense? Like there are other loyalty programs out there. And one of their charts was like ROI. And it was like loyalty customer, first non -loyalty customer. They had like a true ROI with the cost of your contract baked in. And it was like, you pay us $20 ,000 a year. We have driven to your loyalty customers, $200 ,000. Non -loyalty customers, like we haven't driven any.

>>Shane Roach	19:55
Incremental. And so it was easy, like two years in a row to say, I mean, we get 20X ROI on this. Like, it seems like it's a good idea. And so I kept the contract for two years.

>>Emily Brown	20:09
Having worked at Stamps, that ROI calc is complete b******* because the people who are in the loyalty program are the ones who are going to continue to buy versus the ones who aren't in the loyalty program. And so that is like maybe the blessing and the curse. It's actually very hard to prove quote unquote ROI. And so a number of different e -com SaaS tools do this and show this metric. But then like 50 % of the customers are like, well, how do I know that this is actually true? And so then you can degenerate into a fight about whether it's an actual ROI or not. But then the user might want the tool And then they'll just, like if a user wants the tool, they'll use the ROI as a justification, even if it is a b******* number, even if they know that it's a b******* number, but they'll show it to their boss.

>>Shane Roach	21:08
Yes. And I think the human aspect of it is like the human politicking is like 100%. Like how do contracts get renewed? It's because I can show results that this is driving the business forward. Or yeah, I agree, Emily. And I think that's why we've come to this conclusion that we used to do this a long time ago. We don't do it. There's so much variance. How much do we extrapolate? Is it like one month, we just say like, you ran this test and it touches X percent of your orders or shipping test or price test. And it's like, we can extrapolate that because like, that's always going to be true. But if it's a content test that like is a Pdp redesign versus a homepage redesign, it's like, okay, maybe that effect only lasts like two months. So like, I don't know, but if somehow we could do like a crazy discounted ROI, like, and it's just like, like I even discounted internally. I'm like, okay, well, this is says the 20 X, like maybe it's a really a five X that's fine. Like a five X is good enough for me. That's what I would get to. Okay. I know we're getting close to time here, but so we came to Intelligems to do price testing. That's why a lot of people come to us. The next swing, like this is talking with Drew and Adam and Sam, like three years ago, very hands -on, like, great. It's like, you guys should do shipping tests. And this was the next feature we had, like Intelligems had. It was like, okay, great. But those are two like enormous swings. We had a hero product. We had shipping tests, didn't even do any content tasks because it wasn't live yet.

>>Shane Roach	22:50
But saw, we learned something, even though the CEO said no on the price change, we learned something. And it was up to me then when we did plan the next year to say like, the forecast is wrong. And I did my different forecast. The shipping was like immediate gain. And we could, I think you could extrapolate that when it's like $1 .50 saved for every shipment and no conversion impact. Like that's a lot of money when you can say like, we do 200 ,000 orders a year. It's like, great. That's 300 grand in savings that we could then use to budget other way or like go to the bottom line. And we like, then we left. Cause it was just like, we just needed to test these couple things. The tool was really early. It's a way different, way different than where we are now. But I think back to like what the operator cares about. It's like a tool that works. Can I see like wins really quickly, which obviously Emily and all the team is focused on, but like, how do I see a win really quickly? How do I know what to test next? We all know all this stuff. And then how do I look good? Literally like, how do I look good? I'm in charge of the e -commerce channel. Like how do I make myself look good? And I can make myself look good with numbers and sharing test results easily in Slack or over email and screenshots are great. And the Ai summary, like being able to drop something into Slack really quickly and say, we just launched this test. Here's what we tested. Here's what the results, here's the rollout. Here's the next test I'm doing. And then yeah, like everyone just cares about how can I look good and be better?

>>Shane Roach	24:36
So how can we lean into like just psychology of like, I only care about myself. People are selfish. So Craig, did that help give context? Sorry. Yeah, really good.

>>Craig Phillips	24:53
One question I guess.

>>Craig Phillips	24:54
So on the ROI thing, I mean, for you, what was it? Like, what was the number that you were trying to drive? Or was it profitability? Was it something else? Like, what was the thing?

>>Shane Roach	25:09
Yeah, I think because one was just like, yeah, We were trying to drive profitability. And like, when we launched the price test, it was like, we wanted to see the margin. Like, can we drive more profitability by having a higher margin? But it was mostly then, like, the opposite is I wanted to, and the head of ops wanted to validate, like, this is going to impact conversion, which it did. It's like the model, we can show what a few model scenarios look like, but like, for sure, conversion's gonna go down. But we were also in a wholesale omni -channel marketplace. I don't know what percent of our customers are omni -channel. I bet it's 40 or 50%. And so it's different when you're a brand that can control your price point. Like, if you are just selling on your website or you plus Amazon, like, man, I think there's so much more you can do. And so that might even, Emily, I don't know where in the process, but if we can somehow, if we're not already, like, where do you sell? It's like, just my website, my website plus Amazon, or like, my website plus wholesale. There might be like a path of how we direct people. But yeah, Craig, it was just like to validate, like, conversion's gonna drop. I told you so, conversion's gonna drop. We shouldn't increase prices. Oh, we did anyways. And then shipping was just like, how much can we improve margin? But it wasn't like a true, like, Cro, Cro, Cro. Like, we're not trying to do it because the tool wasn't built that way by the time we were using it. So it wasn't like a constant. There wasn't like a roadmap in place. There wasn't like, the tool was just too early and that wasn't the idea. Yeah.

>>Craig Phillips	26:47
Cool. My only other thought was, and it's probably beyond the scope of what we're immediately thinking about, but maybe related to some of the tools that Jerry's kicking around for site -wide or explore tools of the modeling, like that early modeling experience you had, like where you did that in Google Sheets and like how that could be a tool, like a lead into, you know, as we try to crack the nut of recommendations and what you should test, that like having modeling tools that, and maybe that's already something that he's thinking about, but it just felt like that experience could be interesting in that realm, you know?

>>Shane Roach	27:24
Yeah, I think Michael shared something yesterday in Slack that was something similar to that, where it's like, it doesn't need to be crazy. You just need a handful of inputs and you need some data feeding in to be like, okay, cool, what could happen? And we have, you know, the price elasticity calculator and a few things. Like, I think some of these input tools, either in the app or it's like, I don't know, on the lead side, could be interesting. Oh, the other thing I was gonna get to, Craig, that I forgot to say is, in conjunction, we also had like signed a big contract with Nosto, which Nosto like started as like a product recommendation engine for like your collection pages. And then they went into like very much site content experiences. And we were running Nosto in conjunction with Intelligems. But like, we had some set it and forget it site content experiences. Like, if someone, we launched this Nfl collection, it was like, if someone viewed the Nfl collection, because it was a way different buyer than the rest of our customers, it's just like, every time they came back to the homepage, show them the Nfl collection. Because we just like knew. And then for Nfl ads, like we just directed them to that like site content experience. And so on the stickiness side, like I think as we can get more like the pre -draft or like Angel, some of the work you've done on like this new like nudges inside the dashboard pages on each page, it's like, launch like your new visitor experience. It's like, there are a few like table stakes, things that every brand should do that we can direct on the experiences side as like either drafts or like a nudge of like the type they should do.

>>Shane Roach	29:10
It's like new visitor versus returning visitor. Returning visitor should get what you're always updating your theme. New visitors should like, I mean, you can validate this, but like new visitors should get like the brand story and like all the press mentions and like your hero bestseller. And like, I think there's a strong point of view on two experiences or two drafts like per site content versus checkout versus offers that we could probably like pre -fill or like somehow have a nudge to like get people into those tools more.

>>Emily Brown	29:47
At VIA, we had a very similar dynamic where like we were running all these price tests about like,

>>Emily Brown	29:53
Determining elasticity. And then the CEO was like, you just have to raise price, like you just have to do it, like, even though we could prove that like, it was going to hurt the business rather than help the business. And the way that we tried to get a like reconcile that was like, okay, but we're going to touch the least elastic customers most and to like try and negate the bad sides of the price raise as much as we could. And I feel like that we're not really pushing from what I can see into that realm right now of like, hey, you should raise prices on these different, like, segments in different ways, because they've demonstrated different elasticity in the actual test, which would then lead to like, price experience, like always on price experiences. Hmm.

>>Shane Roach	30:44
Yeah. It's like, if you're buying a flight, you like open up a VPN and go to a different country to see like different prices versus I've never actually done that. But same idea. Yeah. Cool. I hope that was helpful. Again, I haven't been to the other conversations, but maybe there was one or two takeaways.

>>Craig Phillips	31:05
Yeah. Really good.

>>Shane Roach	31:07
If anyone wants more nitty gritty on any of this stuff, happy to help.

>>Craig Phillips	31:12
But people just care about themselves.

>>Shane Roach	31:14
They want ROI, they want immediate results and what to do next. That's pretty much it. I'm saying understood you people, not me. I hope I'm not a selfish person, but in general.

>>Helen Keighron	31:28
I think you're right. That's pretty much human nature is like, how can I do as little work as possible and look as good as possible?

>>Shane Roach	31:35
Yeah, exactly. Okay. Sweet.

>>Craig Phillips	31:38
Thanks, Shane.

>>Shane Roach	31:39
Yeah. Thanks everyone.

>>Craig Phillips	31:41
Yeah. See you.
