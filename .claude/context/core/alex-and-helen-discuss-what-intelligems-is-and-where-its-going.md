Me: Hi. How are you?  
Them: How are you doing?  
Me: Hectic, hectic week. I am making a q4 roadmap dac. For the first time that we have had, like, a real roadmap deck for initially for renewals for Q4, because it's such a sensitive time, but I was just going through, and I was like, holy shit, we're about to drop a lot of stuff. And it's like. It's interesting just seeing it all together.  
Them: I saw. I don't know why I was laughing about it so hard by the tweet this morning, and it was like, babe, are you okay? You've barely touched your 2025 roadmap. It's hard sometimes.  
Me: No, We've touched our2025 roadmap. We have beaten it into submission, I would say. But2026, we've got to get on that, too. And. It's like, I don't think sort of the pillars change necessarily, but it's more like of those pillars that we're going after. How do we talk about that to the company? How do we help people understand how it all fits together? And then figure out sort of what's slotting into Horizon 3. I don't know if we have enough information on some of our Horizon 3 stuff now to be able to be like, oh, yeah, we should definitely productize that, pull that forward. I think the AI stuff is, like, the biggest wild card. And what does an orchestrated a giant take experience feel like excited for where we're going, but it is a bit of a conundrum that we are not ready for a planning cycle yet.  
Them: How can I help?  
Me: So I think it's the topic of the narrative. In general. And so Atom is going to do the town hall on Friday, and he's been noodling on some ideas in terms of what to talk about. And when I threw everything into that project, there's been different memos and different thinking from Drew and from Adam and from Kate after she joined and. Then when I put that in light of the company survey, and I was like, this is where people are hung up. How do we tell this story? And I do think it's in the three E's. But it's just. Like I don't have my hands around it in a way where it's like maybe we ground it at a customer story or something and help people actually understand how all the stuff gets applied. What's the thing that's going to stick for people? And so you've been trying to stick to the three E's in marketing, and it seems like that's working really well in terms of the reception of that. So do you think that's the right move, is to just keep hanging on to that?  
Them: Yeah, I think. The three E's have been really effective in terms of categorizing value of the product, especially as we've been building more things. As these components came together and offers came together, it gave us a way to kind of be like, hey, you've known us for experiments. Now we have this extend go build with Intelligems. Don't just experiment. Don't just instrument the orchestrate the tests. So it's been helpful in that way. I think the thing where Adam and I got into a little bit of an argument the other day was. Like, okay. I know how to tell these stories in the market, but I'm still not sure. If someone was flat out like Alex, what is Intelligems? I don't know how I would answer that question succinctly. Right now. I know how I would answer it when I have. Five minutes, ten minutes. 500 words. But not like, what are you. And that's where him and I kind of started to diverge, where he's like, oh, we're a group. What did he say? He didn't say profit growth platform. He's like, oh, it's just like a growth platform. And then he's like. He asked Andrew and I, when I say, growth platform, what does that mean to you? And Andrew and I just stared at him. I'm like, both of us were like nothing, literally nothing. I don't know what that is. And then him and I. Kept on trying to anchor to. If we anchor to testing, but then we're testing, but more testing with the different angle, just like anchoring to that. But your original question of are the ease working? Definitely. That's how when Victor's putting kind of like the strategic content together, we're even thinking about that academy piece, and it's like, okay, how would we organize all of our thoughts? And it's like, okay, well, you need the ideation. The test execution, and then what do you do with the results? And those three things would be the three E's.  
Me: Yeah. And it's tricky because. I think from a retention perspective, Like the data is really clear, like people who have used offers in the past retain better, and like people who use personalizations in general retain better. So. It's not like, clean flywheel. Like, I think the Explorer piece is really, really important. And then obviously, like, there are going to be people who come to us as test for testing as, like, kind of the wedge, right? And then there's like, oh, but you could also run all of your discounts year round. Without necessarily testing them. You might do, like, phases of testing, but then, like, how do we not neglect the always on stuff that we want people to be setting up, like in a cyclical way that definitely doesn't necessarily need to be tested. And that's, like, a tricky thing to talk about. And I think you're right. Like, if we had.  
Them: We see a lot of you. Do we sorry, do we see a lot of usage of offers without testing like of people just sending it?  
Me: So usage is low right now. So usage of offers without testing is about 1% of sessions impacted. That said, that's the exact same percentage of sessions impacted as shipping testing. Right. So it's not nothing like, because we go out and we talk about shipping testing, and you should test shipping. You should do this, you should do that. It's a great way to, you know, I think, pick up profit in a way that's, like, you know, more accessible than, like, playing with margins strictly. And, like, I absolutely want to double down on shipping testing. I think shipping testing is, like, under leveraged in general and could use, like, sort of some design work to, like, make it easier to do. So, like, that's something that we've been talking about, but we want to drive, you know, not just offer testing. But like standalone offer usage. Because as we start to build out, like audience features and things like that, like better klaviyo segmentation and integration and things like that, it all starts to align. Because we'd love to be able to be like, hey. In the sitewide analytics, not only hey, there's a question. You should go test it. Like, that's a no brainer that we'll do that. But it's also like, hey, for this segment of people, this is your most valuable, you know, segment based on LTV or whatever. Like, you should run this campaign. So then it kind of branches and it's like. Testing, yes, but also like this kind of campaign motion. But we don't want to get into like, the email and SMS content or anything like that. But we do want to do potentially like that. Every use case where it's like, all right, if somebody comes through a klaviyo email in a certain segment, they come to the site and it's like, pre personalized, like for them to land on. So, you know, the brand is running a promotion for whatever reason for, for that segment, and we want to be the ones that help get their site ready, like kind of, you know, get it dressed for that visitor, basically, like have the discount that they're eligible for, like, automatically. Applied and have, you know, any visual merchandising done that that syncs with, you know, the creative that they just saw, like in the email, for example.  
Them: Gotcha. Yeah. Another line that has been. Really effective for us on the marketing side is different variations will don't guess no or like this concept of proof. So it's interesting because that's, like, slightly different than testing, per se. I think a lot of people get caught up in testing as, like, oh, CRO optimizations. And I should just be, like, in this constant state of testing, But the proof side of it is. That tweet I did the other day where Mike was like, cfos love it. His thing is, I test not because I'm necessarily trying to find the best of this set. He's like, I test or I run everything through Intelligems. Even if we extend this to offers or, like, campaigns or whatever, it's like I run everything through Intelligems. Because I can prove it to someone. Like, even if I didn't test against three things, it's like, yo, Helen, I just want to do this campaign because, trust me, I know marketing, and I'm just going to run it like this. But then afterwards, I can show the results of it. And I think that's what people get so hung up on with. Ching and Aftership and all these other guys is like, oh, they have all this functionality. But I'd rather just use I've had multiple people say, I'd rather just use Intelligems because. I know what's going. I can go look at what happened and see the results, and that's not as easy to do. In these other tools, or I have to pull those integrations into Intelligems to figure it out. So I don't know if testing is, like, the word, but. There's some form of. Like, I don't know, decision, confidence, proof.  
Me: Yeah. Control.  
Them: Control something along the lines of. Like, even if you don't. I think where I'm trying to delineate here is even if I don't run a test against, like, oh, I have this control, and I think I have something better, and I want to compare those two things. And it's just I want to go do something, but I want to be able to show my boss and show the rest of the team what happened. And like, that second part actually isn't super easy in D to C right now. But, like, that's what we make really easy to do. And like, again, that quote of, like, CFOs love it, CFOs love it. Because I did a thing and, like, here's what happened.  
Me: Yeah. And so we are talking about that as sort of next steps is like fix the experiences, analytics in general. Because right now, like, there's sort of like an. Andrew called it a redheaded stepchild earlier, which is rude. But the interesting thing is, like, with sitewide, we can actually borrow a lot of the site. Wide design and bring that into experiences, analytics, whether that's, you know, site content experiences or offers experiences. And then we also want to shake up the flow to make it really easy to like, add a small hold back. On, you know, any experience that you're serving. So it's not testing it, per se, but it's making it really easy to do exactly what you just said, which is like, did this thing work? You know, and, like, has this worked over time? And can I look at this cohort, you know, of customers that did see this versus that didn't? And I think that's where it gets really interesting.  
Them: And like, I really like that because. It again. Like, the three E's are like, was it. Let's ignore the threes for a second. Let's just, like, talk in generalities. It's like the. When we talk about those things and we, like, speak like that, it. It's all grounded in. Like business realities. Truth. Like the. Like what you have done. And that testing, like, I think the biggest thing we're saying we're seeing is, hey, people are more retentive when they have more to do than set up a test and wait. That sucks. Like, we never want to put people into a hurry up and wait situation. So it's like, hey, here's all these other things you can do. And even though it's not testing like that ant, like the analytics side of this, of just like, hey, I did a thing and I can prove the thing, like, I'm not going to use kaching anymore. I don't want to run. I don't want to go through Klaviyo and go to some rando page on my site. I wanted to go through an Intelligems link because if it does. I can show Helen that my work was meaningful. Or Helen told me to send this campaign. And I was like, helen, that's a really dumb thing to do. And you're like, alex, just do it. And then I send it, and then I show you and I say, see, Helen, it was dumb. These things.  
Me: Wow.  
Them: Regardless of your seniority in the organization. Like, that's valuable to you, right? It's like, hey, I can see what's going on. I can prove my worth. I can prove the worth of a strategy that this. Confidence, control. It's a word salad, but there's something in there.  
Me: Y. Eah. Oh, my gosh. Built for spite.  
Them: Honestly. Spite is a powerful, powerful emotion.  
Me: Everybody needs a nest.  
Them: Right. But. Sorry, one second. Our child is so accident prone. I feel like every two days. Something.  
Me: Oh, buddy.  
Them: He fell, hit his head, and whenever he hurts himself, he never wants anyone to help him. No bandaids, no ice, no nothing. He's fine.  
Me: Was he okay?  
Them: My wife's gonna go get him. They apparently want to send him home. Okay. Sorry. Spite, powerful emotions. What else are we talking about?  
Me: Yeah. I mean, I think, like, the we have to do sort of. Claude called it our AI leap. But we absolutely have to build a lot more intelligence into the platform and make it feel like it was natively built as opposed to a bolt on. So, like, that's where we kind of have to go on the experience side. But I think the agentic CRO concept, like, does hold up. You know, it's ideating, it's analyzing its, you know, implementing and iterating, right? And so maybe there's a place where it's like, testing kind of helps you dial in your strategy. And then our analytics keep you on track and surface opportunities. Some of those will create, you know, branches in the timeline where you want to go tests, because you want to know, like, is this insight, you know, something? That holds up or not, and then other branches will be about like, all right, I'm just going to run with these learnings, like, for this quarter or this half or whatever. And therefore, I'm going to now mediate the site experience and have, like, total control over that in a way that, like, I don't get in shopify, you know, for all these different visitor segments. And then to your point, you don't have to go chase other tools and be like, does keching work with this? So that you know. And so that's where I think it's exciting is like, it is just continuously optimizing. And I know we got away from the optimizing word initially around, like, profit optimization, because that's, like, super unclear. And then profit is obviously, like, a thing that's kind of a differentiator for us. Is it truly a differentiator for us? I actually don't know. Right.  
Them: Not really. It's a differentiator from a story perspective, but it's not really a differentiator from, like, a product feature perspective. Like, what is the feature? For profit. It's cogs upload. Any one of our competitors could easily introduce costs.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then, like, how do we get better than that? Okay? Like, now we import marketing costs. We have like your entire business. Like, we have all costs of goods sold. We have, like, your cost of doing business. Like, the, the more that. I agree with everything you said about, like, the agentic component of this. Is like there's. When I was talking to Adam, I was like, essentially, there's, like, three things that we want this. AI to do. It's like I want it to build for me. I want it to ideate for me, and I want it to help me understand. It's like, be the brain for a second. Be the hands or, like, be the guide. And. If we can. Do those things. Then like, oh, the build. The build on autopilot becomes like, optimization, like you were saying. It's like, Helen, we saw, like, we're seeing this, this and this. We recommend doing this. Maybe there's a. Like, I'm confident in what you guys are doing. So, like, do it for me. Don't even run it by me. Just, like, make those changes and, like, tell me.  
Me: Y. Eah.  
Them: And then there's like, oh, I want my hand on the switch. Instead. It's like, make these recommendations. Kind of like what Google Ads does, where it's like, yo, Alex, you have these optimizations that we think would work. Do you want them click yes.  
Me: Example.  
Them: Boom, boom, boom, boom. And then. But then there's, like, the. Where was I going with this? Anyway, the. The more that we can get into that optimization game. Again. There's a reason one of the biggest competitors in the space is called Optimizely. Like, it's something that people want. Profits a story for us. But like everyone's going to claim it's where D to C is going. And Adam's been, like, really on this, like, growth term. I really hate throw. There's two words that I hate for us. Growth and CRO. Sells us short. And I want to put all of our competitors into a CRO box so that we can be something more. So I don't want us to be using it. But then growth is also kind of like becoming a nasty word, because growth is almost always associated with, like, top line or user growth, like grow revenues grow users. And growth marketing or like advertising in the Shopify space. Is losing a lot of its luster. We're entering. I mean, this is all. I feel like I'm just regurgitating the brand doc at this point. It's like, there's all this. There's this motion of like, hey, that marketer isn't king at a D to C brand anymore. The person who is is like, that operator. Who's the one looking at the margin profiles? Who's the one looking at operations and logistics and, like, the fundamentals of the business and the more that Intelligems can sit and, like, help that person. Understand the fundamentals of the business and, like, execute and ideate and, like, optimize towards, like, the best outcome. Then we're in, like, a really good spot. And if AI comes in, And like Helen sitting in that operators that operator seat at the brand, and she feels like she has this brain that she's looking at. It's like, Alex is up to this. Whatever fucking crazy shit he does on the marketing side. And, like, oh, look, all of this stuff's in here. I can see that. Like, it is moving the needle. Hey, I have this crazy idea. I want to go test it. But Intelligems just has these other things on autopilot, and, like, I trust them to do that. It's like if we can get to a point where we're always moving forward for the brand. And then you said the word intervention. I like that. Where it's. Like. Okay, but I have an idea. I don't care what Intelligems thinks. Like, the best thing is right now, I think this could be a game changer for my business.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: And I want to interject and I want to fork it or like, whatever that term is. So, like, I'm really high on the agentic. Again. We got really hung up the other day on, like, what is it? Agentic? What?  
Me: Yeah. I heard a gentic growth is where you all landed, which sounds like. It's still.  
Them: I. I can seeded there. I was like, I. I will go there because originally it was like agentic CRO and I was like, I do not want that. But, yeah, growth better than CRO. I don't know. I don't know if I'm even helping you or if I'm just me asking more questions.  
Me: No, I think it's really helpful to just talk through it because it's like everybody's got, like, a slightly different take on it, and it is, like, a little bit of an existential crisis. Like, I don't think what we're doing is. Like. A pivot necessarily. Like, we're in this, like, product expansion moment. And we obviously want to keep improving the core, you know, which I think is, like, a major wedge for sales and for, like, discovery on the App Store and things like that. Right. And so. There. That makes sense. You know, obviously, we're still the testing platform, and it's like a major component of what we do. But I do think, like, the. The three E's and kind of, you know, building out explore, which we didn't have before. Right. And then building out, you know, better ways to. Sort of extend and, you know, manipulate experiences. It's almost like we're like this missing operating system that, like, lives on top of Shopify, and I don't know how to say it either. Right. And that's the problem. It's like Shopify gets you there in terms of, like, we spit. Out products into templates. And, you know, it's kind of a blunt instrument in a lot of ways. And then. We take it like the last mile. In terms of, like, giving you, like, true control over your visitor experience and, you know, making, like, the best choices for each visitor. So, like, some of the. There's something in there about making good choices.  
Them: I. I tried to coin it decision intelligence a few months ago.  
Me: Because, like, that's already a thing in software, so. That's a tough optimize around, but.  
Them: I mean. We only really need to optimize inside of the Shopify, like, e commerce ecosystem, at least right now, and then, like, build into something else. It's not like we're going after everyone. But yeah.  
Me: Give ourselves the opportunity to get off Shopify, too. Like, that's another big thing that we have to tackle. Like, at least do the research for that, like, next year.  
Them: That's fine. Like from. Whatever we want to own. We can make progress to. Like, if you. It's not like tomorrow I can snap my fingers and, like, we're known for whatever, whatever we decide. But, like, if that's where we're going in the next year, like. If we decide what we're doing and we want to get there within the year. I promise I can make that happen. Like, for, like a ripple, right? Like, we'll start with this concentration. Then we go out a ring, we go out a ring. We go outer ring, we go outer ring. And, like, we keep on doing it. So I wouldn't necessarily be. Too worried about. Oh, that's a thing in a different industry or that's a thing like that is going to be hard to own. We can figure that out if it's the best thing to do. But, like, you use the word choice. I mean, if you have this call. To, like, run back through. I think we both use the word decision or choice. Multiple times. Like, what are we ultimately providing? Smarter decisions, better choices. I don't know what the word I want here is, but, like, provable choices, right? Like, what's a better word for that? Objective. Like there's. There's something sitting there. Because, like, when I say testing, like, yes, that's something. That's something that we can own. The way. I'll say this is, like, testing is actually pretty Greenfield in Shopify right now. Like, no one really owns that. Like, we're starting to own it. I would say, like, AB testing. Is that what we are? Long term? Probably not. And, like, even if you take testing through the three E's, it doesn't work. Testing is only explore and experiment. Extend is not testing. You test to get an understanding to go launch something. So it feels like there's, like, a divide there. But again, like, I'm. I'm really struggling for, like, what is the container? For the three E's. And like, I keep on hovering around. Proof. Decisions. Choices. Optimizations is like close ish. But yeah. It's not hurting us, per se, but it is. Not naming the thing. Or I shouldn't say that. We've named it Profit Growth. Like a profit growth platform? But I think anyone if we put them in a situation instead describe Intelligems we're not naturally say. Profit growth platform. And if they do, then as profit growth platform. Let me explain that. And then we go and we go and talk about the stuff we just talked about.  
Me: Maybe we'll invent a new word in the English language by the time we're done with this.  
Them: Feels like.  
Me: We have to make fetch happen here, but. Yeah, I know. You're totally right. And, like, it's a hard story to tell, and I think. The container does kind of change how the product is architected. Like, we're going to try to take swings at this. We have an offsite product and design team in a couple weeks, and we're going to try to do like, okay, what's the connective tissue here? Like? So if we have all of these things that you can do, kind of firing on all cylinders. Like, how are we actually sticking them together and helping people understand? Like, what is this thing I'm here to do, you know? What do I get from this? And we're going to try and kind of feel our way through that, like, on the design side. And try to get to just a description of an experience. Basically, it might start as a narrative and end up with, like, some clickers or something. So we're going to kind of wrestle with that, and so something might come out of that. Like, in the meantime, like, I don't have a better answer than profit growth platform. But you have. You're right that you have to, like, immediately follow with, like. That's because it does this, this, and this.  
Them: Yeah, like, okay, how do you get to more? Because everyone's going to claim. Like every software in the world, is either going to claim that it makes you money, saves you money, or saves you time. It's not. That's not differentiated. Like, we. We have changed. We have been where we got more specific. On the make money. We're saying profit. Which I like. Like as a marketer. The more specific we can get, the better. I like that we're moving to profit and not just, like, make more money. But at the end of the day, every single app on Shopify is going to claim that.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's going to make you more money. It's like the how. That becomes really important.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And the how is living in that intersection of those ease. That we don't have a name for.  
Me: That is true. I might just feed this all back into the Claude Project and see if I can tease anything out. Because it's already loaded up with, you know, other contacts, so that might be worth it. And it's like, I'm clear on, like, what we're building and, like, why we're building it, but you're right that it's, like, I think that's a barrier to the rest. Of the company, too, to understand, like, why are we putting emphasis over here versus there? You know, somebody was like, of all the things you all decided to do, why was it offers? You know, and it was like, okay, great. There's, like, a number of factors for that. You know, we can definitely, like, speak to that, but. It's like, there's the retention piece, and there's the fact that, like, it was a capability we already had that was, like, dramatically under utilized. And then it would let us sort of, you know, potentially not steal. Share is not, like, the right word, but we have a lot of conflict with people trying to test, you know, keqing and, like, bundling apps and things like that. And it's like, okay, so if we just built some of that in, then we have our own version that cuts a lot of noise out of the process, too. And, like, ultimately, like, it all comes back to retention. So I don't know. Like, there's. There was definitely, like, clear reasons for doing it, and now, like, we're. We're aggressively trying to, you know, drive adoption there, and that will continue. I think checkout is similar, which is like, okay, we've just expanded into a new surface layer, right? Like. For profit. And, like, that's exciting, like, being able to get into checkout. It's still really clunky, like, how we have to actually go about it. I don't know if you've seen Kate's demos or not, but it's like, there's things you do in intelligence. And there's things you do on Shopify, and, like, I just, like, I hate that so much. But it's a new surface layer. And then, like, we continue to expand beyond that. Like, we get into post checkout and, you know, like, eventually it's like, okay, every area of your site that can possibly help tip someone into, you know, being a purchaser or not maybe being a purchaser or, you know, increasing their order value or whatever. Like we will have a hook into it.  
Them: I like that there. There's two kind of, like, terms. Like there's, like, a depth and breadth. Argument here, too, right? Where it's like, okay. What are we working on? Like, if we define those pillars as like Explores the data layer, experiments the testing layer and experiences is like what the customers actually interacting with. We can have, like, more surface in all of those, but we can also have more depth. In all of those. Like, hey, more surface area inside of experiences. Checkout blocks. We now have more surface area. Is it a super deep experience yet? No. So it's like, hey, we're actually, like, expanding what we are able to use. Or, like, you can then do the surface in the experiment as well, where it's like, hey, you can now build those, but you can't necessarily experiment on them right now. Okay. The experiment needs more surface or more breadth. But yeah. Like, hey, we build in these things. And like, I see AI like all of these AI features. Like I was saying this to Adam the other day. It's like I don't see it. Like, people keep on talking to me like it's this, like, new feature. But to me, it's not a feature. Like, I know you're going to agree with this, right? It's. It's not a feature. It's actually just like living in the intersection of everything. To make like, like. Everyone out there. Says, oh, testing is an ideas game. And it's like, how do you get as many high quality ideas? Validated. So it's like, there. There's two problems there. How do I come up with the ideas and, like, how do I actually instrument those? To learn. And then something we used to say at repeat all the time was like, data is like if. If you just have the data, but you can't act on it. That's just a spreadsheet. I can give you a gajillion spreadsheets, Helen, but doesn't mean you're gonna do anything. You'll be super informed, but, like, you're not going to do anything with it. So, like, it's this, like, insight to action, like, that's the piece that we're. Missing with testing, right? It's like you gain all this insight, but it's missing the action layer.  
Me: Yeah. Exactly.  
Them: And I love the AI component of this because, like, you can apply it to so many things. Like, hey, I actually have great ideas. I just suck at building the actual, like, instrumenting the test. Let's do that for you. Hey, I have all these learnings, but, like, they're not actually getting into live experiences on the site. Hey, let's help you with that. Like, it literally is just living. The three E's are like pieces, but there's actually, like, the connector. Like, it's. Meant to be that flywheel, right? Of, like, I don't know if it's truly a flywheel, but, like. Moving from I have enough data to make a great hypothesis as either. I have enough. I have enough information to make a great hypothesis. Either I looked at it and created a great hypothesis or IntelligenceMEMS and the AI looked at it and created a great hypothesis. There's a linkage there that, like, I don't think we are users are great at, and AI could be amazing at it. I get the experiment going. There's now results from the experiment. What do I do with that? Like, honestly, the AI feature we have right now of, like, here's the summary and, like, chat with it. That's fucking dope. Because then I can be like, what is this actually telling me? Like, what should I go do with this? Either, like, I can do it or AI can do it. And, like, hey, this experience is going. And, like, maybe the thing that connects the flywheel is like, helen, you launched this thing. Three months ago. Let's make sure that's still true. Like, let's make sure that's still the reality of today. Let's run it back. So, like, hey, we're getting all these ideas, but some of the ideas and some of the things to do are actually just like. Nate talks about this on his podcast all the time, where it's. Like what was true six months ago. I want to know if it's still true because I don't want to keep operating on bad information.  
Me: Yeah, totally. Yeah, there's something. There's something in here for sure. What do we want to be when we grow up? Anyway, on Friday you will hear Adam talk about we're a profit growth platform and I think he's going to cover off on just sort of the evolution of Intelligems, you know, to some extent. And talking about, like, product market fit. And it's like, you kind of have to, like, refind it periodically. Right. And, like, I think we're, we're in one of those places where we have product market fit, you know, for some customers on testing. But, you know, we want to serve more customers, and we've probably got, like, a TAM limit in terms of Shopify. Like, we could probably get to 50 million in ARR or even 100 million ARR. But then it's like, okay, we're gonna have to go beyond that, right? And so that's where that starts to get interesting, too. And he's gonna say growth agent probably a bunch of times. And, yeah.  
Them: I'm not. I'm not fussed about it. I like I. We need to keep moving.  
Me: Yeah. Like lightly triggering. Yeah, but then we're gonna give some examples around, like, hey, this is, like, offers in action. Like, here's. Here's what you know, these brands have already done with it. And Shane's in this mode where he's trying to build case studies. Like, it's been long enough for some interesting. Things have happened, and we want to get case studies off of that. I think that'll be helpful. We're also gonna run, not necessarily like a promotion, but we have to figure out, like, sort of the mechanics of this. But basically, like anyone, even if you're on core and you want to test offers, we'll give you 30 days of that feature turned on, basically, you know, and then hopefully that'll potentially drive some upgrades. So we're just still pulling levers to try to get to adoption. But like, when you look at the product metrics dashboard, like, we actually are like, you know, we're sort of at an all time high in terms of, you know, percent sessions impacted and, you know, just like usage, active usage in general and then when you cross reference that, like, it definitely is being driven by offers. And I think, check out, like, there's very high interest. Like, I think something like, I want to say, like, 80 people or 90 people, some ridiculous amount, have, like, reached out to Kate to be like, turn this on for me. Which if you think of that in the perception, like, the percentage of our active customer base, like, that's actually huge.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Let's try feeding this back into your cloud project. I haven't like. I have my own chat GPT. Combo going kind of like the same. Like, literally just like, talking at a wall, trying to figure. Figure it out. Let's see what we come like. I think. I think we're aligned on the fact that. There's some AI lives in the intersection. It's not a feature. It's like helping us be a better version of this thing that we can't name. That thing that we can't name is like, the container. For all this. What do. What do we want to call that? Also. If helpful. I don't know if it is. All of my musings from the past are, like, just chilling in different pages in here. Like, some of it's incomplete thoughts, some of it's more complete thoughts. But also might help feed in.  
Me: I can feed this in. That's an awesome idea. I was looking for this the other day, and I could not find it, and I was like, what is wrong with me? But I'm glad to encounter it again. Yeah. And interesting. I like the archetypes. Okay, cool. Yeah, like, let me try that out. I will feed that back in.  
Them: Not even necessarily like the archetypes at the. At the bottom or whatever, but. These talking points that. Somebody's talking points, like, who they're important to. I know. Like, we did the exercise of, like, the different Personas, and we had a bot. Like, I tried to, like, simplify and just be like, you got builders, you got managers. You got someone who's, like, sitting on top of all of that, like. Who. Who cares about these different things? Why do they care about them? Do they actually care about the same thing? It's just, like, talked about a different way. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah, I think this is super, super helpful, so let me layer that in. The other thing we haven't really mined yet. And this is like anyone could do this. Maybe I will get a wild hair and do this later, but all of those feedback as a hook calls. I don't think we've done a synthesis. Like, we have the transcripts right, but a lot of those are you know, really interesting in terms of, like, just people talking about, like, the problems they're trying to solve and, like, what's their pain and what do they wish they could do? And, like, I think there's something in there to extract, too.  
Them: Let me know when you have a chance to listen to some of those like I there. They're interesting to me. Where. There's one that actually, I'm gonna send you these two calls because there was one call where this guy was talking to Adam, and he's like, oh, like, it just makes sense to me. Now and, like, it didn't make sense when Matt talked to me about it, and I was like,  
Me: Oh, okay.  
Them: Let me. Let me look at these. So I'm like, I'm gonna listen to Matt's calls. Matt's call first. Like, did he mess something up? Like, why are they saying it didn't make sense? And it. Not that it didn't make sense. They pulled him into some very, like, specific, like, deep dive shit pretty quick, and he went there and, like, he didn't stay. High level, and then Adam did, but, like, there's anyway. Actually, I'm not gonna taint.  
Me: No, no.  
Them: You on this. I'm just gonna send you the calls.  
Me: You. I've listened to a few of the ones that Drew did. I think I listened to probably, like, the first five or six, but then I was like, shoot, like, we aren't aggregating these in any way. To see, like, are there trends? Are there commonalities? Because we get a lot of information, like, from the different brands, so I might do that. But, yeah, definitely send me the ones that you're talking about. That sounds interesting.  
Them: Anything. What you're trying to do here. Like I'm also. Trying. To your point, I don't think it's necessarily. Restricting us right now, but, like, it's getting annoying that, like, we can't.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Define. Like if you said, hey, Alex, if we don't solve this in the next three weeks, are we screwed? No. If we did solve it, would we have an easier time communicating? Like. I guess the big. The big worry here is, like, the team's growing fast. And if we don't have, like, an easy way to. Spread what we are, why we care. And have, like, a point of view on, like, the market and the product and, like, the intersection. Then people just start building. And it's not actually like building. For a specific person or for a specific job.  
Me: Yeah, absolutely. I definitely don't want that to happen. So trying to. I think you're right. Like, we're both trying to solve the same quest, and then, like, the way we express that will be, like, slightly differently in terms of, like, external messaging versus, like, how we're, like, structuring things and. Telling the story to the company and stuff like that. But it is, it is the same problem. It's like, have we actually stumbled on something that is not being done in the industry? Like, truly. And can we claim that? Can we defensively claim that?  
Them: People. Let's go. Let's explore this like proof. Idea or, like, choice idea, because, like. People are seeing a lot of value in us. Of like, I have this other tool. And I want to use Intelligems to tell me if that tool is doing what it says. It's doing.  
Me: Yeah, super interesting.  
Them: Which is like. We've never marketed that use case. People are just, like, gravitating to it and being like, this is great. Interesting. Anywho. I'm just rambling. Now. Let me. If you have a breakthrough on this, let me know. If I. If I think of anything, I'll send it over your way. And yeah, for Friday with talking about this. I'm good with wherever we are right now because, like, I know you're thinking. I know you're thinking about it the same way that I'm thinking about it, so.  
Me: Well, I will chat with you later. This was very helpful. Even though we didn't solve anything, at least we're wrestling with the same thing. So thank you for the bringing. All right, I'll see you later.  
Them: All right. Sounds good.  
Me: Bye.
