# HK - AI thoughts

Thereâ€™s a clear path where we make existing Intelligems features significantly easier to use through agentic capabilities, with more guidance and human-centered workflows. Weâ€™ve already talked about dynamic pricing, infinity testing, generative content options, and I think we can get to a really solid story there. Iâ€™m bullish on our core near term concepts:

1. CRO agent
2. Dynamic pricing
3. Infinity testing
4. Some kind of MCP/API integration with tools merchants are already using in their business

But Iâ€™ve been thinking a ton about what comes next, and I think as we build into the obvious possible, we could make some good choices to set ourselves up to go broader. That probably looks like investment into our API and thinking a lot more about data syndication to start with. 

The horizon 3 game is all about moving from site optimization to positioning ourselves as the profit optimization layer across all online commerce. As the world quickly becomes accustomed to heavily AI-mediated commerce, Intelligems can lead in profit orchestration & help merchants truly see the big picture. Merchants will always need profit optimization, regardless of where transactions occur. Whoever nails cross-channel analytics in this world will have an advantage in telling that profit story. Merchants are also going to feel extreme pressure in a world of disintermediated transactions - they are used to controlling their king of owned channels - the storefront, but their tactics will have to change. 

We will end up with a strategic gap if we donâ€™t lean into a few of the following pressure points or at least war game them out so we have a perspective. Letâ€™s say thereâ€™s a point where 50% of sales are no longer on a merchant site at all. So then what?

What if we could deliver on:

- Being the source of truth/powering dynamic pricing beyond the website
    - Google shopping graph
    - ChatGPT product positioning
    - Perplexity commerce (lukewarm on that one)
    - What tf is Anthropic doing here?
    - Cross-platform price testing
- AI platform optimization tools -
    - Merchants are about to freak out about prompt optimization. Itâ€™s not about keywords and structured data, itâ€™s about natural language (including voice search patterns) and teeing up contextual use cases and comparisons. The merchantâ€™s site content is going to have to do a lot of lifting as different AI platforms look for different types of content and even weight the tone of content differently - this is a discrete concept we could pull out of a bigger vision for sure. The site still matters, but itâ€™s about what it powers elsewhere.
    - Cross-platform content testing
    - AI channel performance analytics dash
        - discovery - where do your products show up?
        - competitive - is AI giving you an edge over competitors?
        - conversion and profit from AI channels
        
    
    Besides the ENG lift and need to double down on building out data science and an ML team, being able to pull this off would require some real partnership work with AI commerce platforms. We sit on a ton of data and there could potentially be some data exchange agreements. Thereâ€™s obviously revenue model implications. We could even potentially white label some tools for an AI platform.
    
    So what would this look like, how would we tell the story about Universal Profit Optimization? Is that a story you want to be able to tell? We could be really strong advocates for merchants and help them with the shift away from owned channels. This feels a bit like looking around the corner at a fundamentally different company, but also defensible based on our dna and the foundation youâ€™ve built.
