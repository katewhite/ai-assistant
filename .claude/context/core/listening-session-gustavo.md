Fall 2025

>>Craig Phillips	00:00
Office, which is, you know. Good luck. Christophe said he might be a minute or two late.

>>Angel Austin	00:42
Anyone have any fun Halloween plans?

>>Craig Phillips	00:47
I told you, Angela, my son has a Halloween party, because people don't really trick or treat here. So we're doing a Halloween party at home. I don't know why we're doing it, because now I have to think about organizing it. But we're doing it.

>>Angel Austin	01:04
Just throw on The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, and candy, and you got the night. Oh, you got the app, too.

>>Craig Phillips	01:14
Oh, yeah. It didn't turn out very good. Yeah, there's like two houses in my neighborhood, but there's this app, someone told us about here, where people can, like, self -report if they have candy for trick -or -treaters. But, like, yeah, our neighborhood, there's two. So you can try it. But also, like, I don't want to self -report myself there. It feels weird.

>>Craig Phillips	01:46
How are you, Angel? Are you carrying on your family tradition? No.

>>Angel Austin	01:51
We have a, like, giant inflatable dino out front, and Allie just loves it. It's so fun. We're going to do, we're going to go down to Family's House in Utah. It feels like, in some areas of Utah, it feels like Stranger Things, like the old time, just small city stuff. People hand out, like, homemade donuts. They have chili when you come to their house, that kind of energy.

>>Craig Phillips	02:17
Chili. Yeah. Wow.

>>Angel Austin	02:21
That's kind of fun. Kate, what about you? What are the twins up to?

>>Kate White	02:28
Oh, we kind of do the usual. They, like, have a parade at school or whatever on Friday. And then we actually gather with all, like, all of our neighbors, just right down the street. And all the moms hang out by the fire in the driveway and pass candy out all at that one house. And the dads take the kiddos around the neighborhood for trick -or -treating. But yeah, that's kind of it. Nothing too special.

>>Angel Austin	03:06
It's a nice division of labor.

>>Craig Phillips	03:09
Very fun.

>>Kate White	03:11
It's nice. It's also, like, especially when they were littler. Now I don't care as much. It's always very, very cold. And, like, they just don't want to have anything to do with us. They're just running from House to house. But when they were littler, I was like, I would always go at least for a little while and then meet back up with the moms because it's cute. You don't want to miss your kids trick -or -treating. But it is nice to just sit by the fire instead and hang out.

>>Craig Phillips	03:37
It's super fun.

>>Hannah Patterson	03:45
We're going to a Halloween party and we got a group of, like, eight of us to all dress up as Waldo. And we think it's really funny.

>>Angel Austin	03:53
There's, like, too many Waldos. You can always find a Waldo.

>>Hannah Patterson	03:56
You can always find a Waldo.

>>Angela Wang	04:02
I just have, like, friends hosting, like, a housewarming slash Halloween party. And I've been working very hard on my partner's costume all week. Mine is, like, very simple. So he's going to be a lily pad and I will be a frog. Hey, guys.

>>Craig Phillips	04:23
Hey, Gustavo.

>>Gustavo Refosco	04:24
Sorry I'm late. Good evening. We do not have so much people here.

>>Craig Phillips	04:30
You have more sun there than I have.

>>Gustavo Refosco	04:34
Just a little bit, maybe. Hey, Hannah.

>>Craig Phillips	04:38
All right. Cool. Well, thanks, Gustavo, for giving us some of your time and your wisdom. Of course. Hopefully, did I give you enough of a brief to, like, give a sense of what to learn?

>>Gustavo Refosco	04:52
Yeah. I can definitely walk you guys through what the process is right now and what I think

>>Gustavo Refosco	04:58
Challenges are. I took some notes before joining the call because I had something, but I think we can just go through your notes. Let me just share my screen.

>>Gustavo Refosco	05:19
So I think just starting with, let me know when you can see it.

>>Craig Phillips	05:26
Do you see intelligence? Perfect.

>>Gustavo Refosco	05:30
So for the onboarding process, I think it didn't change much from when I was doing it under Hannah's leadership. So in terms of what we do in the app, I basically walk them through setting up a test. Well, first, if they are coming for a price test, I talk to them a little bit about integration. So that's something that I try to do something kind of like a more of a high -level explanation of what integration means, what entails, what we have done, the prices. And then I typically just walk them through creating the first test together. So I'll typically just select a price test and walk them through each of the steps. I explain each step separately. So I start explaining what the test groups are. Under modifications, I walk them through selecting the products they'll be testing, heading something to the test. I think the comments I have about these, I think what works and whatnot, some of them are not entirely related to the product, but there are some other ones that might be minor things. Like for example, one thing that always bothered me is that the add button is a little bit hidden when you come to the screen. And then unless you scroll down a little, it's not pretty obvious that you have to do that and add it. And if you click save, it also doesn't tell you that you have to add a product first. It just says the price is not properly configured. So just a minor cosmetic thing maybe. Anyways, I walked them through how they came. Hold on, Gustavo, you went through that too fast.

>>Emily Brown	07:08
What is wrong with the alert? I get that the add button, we should see it, but what is the alert not telling us that it should be telling us?

>>Gustavo Refosco	07:19
So the alert is telling us price is not properly configured when it should tell us add the products to the test or something like that.

>>Craig Phillips	07:35
So that error shows up when you haven't added, when you try to save it without - When you try to save it without actually adding.

>>Emily Brown	07:44
Without pressing that button that's hidden down below.

>>Gustavo Refosco	07:48
Yeah, the add button is still a bit hidden. The error stays. Yeah, the error stays because then it's to price is not properly configured. I just think it should be two separate errors, one for adding the products and one for configuring the prices.

>>Emily Brown	08:07
Yeah, okay. So we have like multiple steps in a flow that people need to take, but we're not necessarily walking them through. Cool.

>>Gustavo Refosco	08:19
Yeah, I think so. Cool. So next I typically explain on how we are just using the current prices for control and how they can fill out the prices for new group one. One thing that I found is not very obvious to a lot of clients is how they can just type in their prices here. There is a drag option here, or even they can copy and paste, pretty much like Excel. I realized that because I was doing a kickoff these days and when I started doing these things, the client pointed out that they didn't realize they could do that. I think it's not. There are a few indications here. I just don't think they expect this would work similarly to Excel or Google Sheets. Not sure if there's a way to make this more evident unless they try it. They only find that out if they try it.

>>Gustavo Refosco	09:17
Right. And then I also tell them how they can just use the quick view. I guess one thing that is not very obvious to all of them is how the quick view will just apply the same. If you use the formula, it's just going to apply the same thing for every product. So typically I explain that. And then I tell them they can do the upload if they want. It's not uncommon for me to get questions from clients that have already seen this on what they should do if they want to do an upload, where can I get a template, etc. Even if I had shown them this before, and it happened a few times, which makes me wonder if there is a way we can make it more

>>Gustavo Refosco	09:57
More evident what they need to do. I don't know in which way we could do that. But for example, maybe we could have some sort of progress. Not sure if a progress bar or some sort of progress where they can see what step they should do next. So maybe at this point, they would see that the next step for them would be to set up prices, and then this is how you can do it. I don't know. Just thinking about ways we can make it more evident on what they should do next. Cool. And stop me at any time if you have any questions. Otherwise, I'll just keep going. Let's see what else. Typically explain the different things you have under targeting, configure analytics, et cetera. For targeting, when I get to this point, I talk about the currency. And one thing I notice very often, almost always, really, when I store sales in different currencies is they are always taken by surprise by the fact that, well, first, that the test is locked in their default currency. And then second, how other currencies will be affected when the test is started, if they are testing a higher price. So these are all things I typically take some time explaining during the kickoff call. And it's typically a surprise and not a very good one.

>>Angel Austin	11:32
And that's because they want to maybe sell different price points to different locations?

>>Gustavo Refosco	11:41
Sometimes they don't want to do multi -currency testing. They just didn't know that, first, they wouldn't have this option by default unless they are on blue and that we are locked in the default currency. And the second one, which I think is the most important one, most of these clients don't realize that if they're testing higher prices and they are automatically converting their prices, any customers in other currencies will be affected and see higher prices. And it's typically a surprise that comes up during the kickoff call.

>>Angel Austin	12:14
Gotcha.

>>Gustavo Refosco	12:17
Cool. Let's see what else. Yeah. And then Configure Analytics, typically, I cover this section briefly. I don't think there is necessarily a problem with this. I think everything is properly explained here that these are the ones that are displayed by default in the main results page. If you want, you can add a few other metrics here. I don't really see necessarily a problem with this page. I typically just go through it quickly, explaining what things mean.

>>Emily Brown	12:53
I'm curious about your thoughts on how important is it to go through this before they launch the test? Maybe separating custom metrics from all the other things? How have you seen, if you're talking to them and explaining this tab to them, do you think that impacts how they think about setting up their test or the metric that they're looking to track in the test? Or is this just more of an FYI?

>>Gustavo Refosco	13:28
It's typically more like an FYI, especially because most of these brands are onboarding for a price test or sometimes a shipping test. So we hardly use custom metrics in those cases. So I just give them a quick walkthrough. And now, for these ones, I tell them we have all of these available, which you can select from just to change the visibility, but not something they should worry about before running the test. So it's more of a FYI when we go through this section here.

>>Kate White	13:58
Yeah, I had the same question, because those don't actually change any way that we track metrics, right? What's the difference between just having those options once you're on the Analytics page and one of you, a certain thing?

>>Gustavo Refosco	14:15
Yeah, exactly. Unless we're talking about a custom metric which needs to be configured beforehand, depending on the custom metric you're adding. But again, it's typically not used for a price test. I'll say that the one that commonly causes more question is really when we are talking about currency and targeting. And then they start asking things about, like, maybe we can target a specific audience, like maybe excluding people coming from Google, because they're concerned about the difference in pricing that people might see between Google and Amazon. Or maybe they're concerned about the difference between Google and their site, things like that. I typically always recommend that they just run the test for everyone. And I explain how we are increasing prices and avoiding that someone sees higher prices. But this is always a little bit of a pain point.

>>Gustavo Refosco	14:56
Point, and again, typically not a very good surprise when they don't realize that beforehand, that we won't be able to change prices elsewhere other than the site, and that we are increasing prices to be able to run the test. Cool.

>>Emily Brown	15:17
I guess, so after we, I'm not sure that everyone has the context of your comment of increasing prices in order to run the test. Perhaps people do, but maybe if you can just explain what you mean by that and why that is the thing that happens.

>>Gustavo Refosco	15:37
Sure. So let's say, for example, that you are testing a higher price here. So when we start this test, we will update the prices on Shopify to the highest prices in the test. And that's the one thing that customers sometimes are not, our clients are not aware of when they come to run a price test with us.

>>Craig Phillips	16:01
Do you find many of our customers have done price testing in other tools, or is this kind of more their first time doing it, and you're walking them through the context and a lot of the details?

>>Gustavo Refosco	16:15
I feel that most of the time, it's their first experience doing something like this.

>>Craig Phillips	16:21
Cool.

>>Gustavo Refosco	16:25
Another pain point that also happens quite a lot before we even dive into the preview is, and this is not related to the screens we are seeing here, but a lot of times, these brands are coming to the kickoff call without knowing what they will be testing. So I don't know. Maybe it would be nice if there is something around their first taps that really pushes them into thinking what they want to test. And I know sometimes they don't do that because they don't really know exactly which price points they should test. So there are some difficulties around that as well. And that's also one pain point that sometimes makes it, causes it like the onboarding of a brand to be very lengthy because they take a long time to really decide on what they want to test and start a test. So even if we get integration done quickly, sometimes a brand takes weeks to actually start price testing.

>>Craig Phillips	17:28
So your call with them is more to, it's kind of educational. You're teaching them how to do it, like the mechanics of setting it up. Yeah. But it would never go into the realm of you actually holding their hand to get the first test set up. Is that because you just don't, we don't do it that way? Or because they typically don't even know what they want to test?

>>Gustavo Refosco	17:53
If they knew what they want to test already and we have integration ready, I will walk them through the entire process. And sometimes we are able to get a test live even during the kickoff. But if they don't know what they want to test, then typically what I do is just showing them how they can set this up in the app. And I'll give them the resources and tell them what the integration, how the integration was done, what they need to do to publish our theme and get the test live once they are ready. But then the kickoff becomes more of like a, let's say like an instructional call so they know what to do in the app once they get in.

>>Angela Wang	18:30
Is it like a lot more friction for customers to launch a price test versus content tests or any other tests? Do you feel like it's a very clear division between those or is it everything?

>>Gustavo Refosco	18:41
Not necessarily, it all depends on whether they come with a good testing plan. If they are experienced with A -B testing or if they just plan accordingly, then it doesn't make much of a difference if it's a price or a content test. I've seen brands doing both, either doing it quickly or taking a long time to execute.

>>Gustavo Refosco	19:15
So typically once we get their test done and if they don't know what they want to test, they still go through them on like selecting maybe a couple of products and just so we have something they can look at. And then we typically dive into the preview. Let me see if I can find a price test here. Okay, I'll just preview this one.

>>Gustavo Refosco	19:44
So for the preview, I basically walked them through what they have at their disposal in terms of like previewing the different experiences, different test groups. I explained what they expect to see.

>>Gustavo Refosco	19:55
Price tagging means. Because typically, this is something we are doing for them. So seeing these highlights and what this price tagging means is something that these brands only come across when we actually have the kickoff call. And I explain that to them. I think if it's something that they, if we just delivered the integration and maybe didn't have the kickoff call, it wouldn't be clear to them why they're seeing these highlights and why they are green or blue. And so I typically just walk them through what the preview looks like, what they should be looking at. And I kind of like reinforce how they should QA every price test they do and check every page, like collections on page, BDPs, to make sure things are updating accordingly. And typically, for a price test, we don't really dive into the editor itself. So that's as far as we go in the price test onboarding.

>>Craig Phillips	21:02
Cool.

>>Gustavo Refosco	21:02
Let me see what other questions you had. I do have a few comments on other types of tests as well. I think each of them have some improvements we could use. We can just talk about those quickly.

>>Craig Phillips	21:15
Yeah, I'd be interested, like, even zooming out. I mean, the detailed thoughts are really good to hear. I'm also interested just, like, zooming out of all the conversations you have. Like, are there certain things that are always, like, sticking points or always confusing or always, like, mental hurdles that you need to get the customer over to, like, understand? Like, I don't know. It's like, you know, because we're really looking at, like, a lot of early usage. Somebody starts using intelligence for the first time and they're getting stuck on themselves. So that early stuff of, like, the early concepts. And I'd be interested to know what stands out to you from running all these onboarding calls of, like, where do people get stuck?

>>Gustavo Refosco	22:01
I think that the first two would be, where do they get started, really? So which type of test should they run? Which test should they run? Or if I know I want to run a price test, which price should I test? A lot of these clients don't really know what they want to test. So that would be point number one, which hopefully maybe site -wide analytics will help a little bit with. But maybe just having more of an opinion from our end on what they should be testing. Because they're coming to us, seeing us as the experts. And sometimes they're not looking just for a walkthrough of the ad, but really, what should be testing? I guess the second one is just ensuring that intelligence is live and integrated. So a lot of these brands, I guess a lot of the people I'm talking to don't fully comprehend the integration we are doing on a Shopify theme, how they need to keep those things live. So I talk to them a lot about these steps to ensure intelligence is live and working for every test they try to run. So these are the two main things that I see a lot of friction on, on what to test and how to make sure my integration is working.

>>Emily Brown	23:12
By integration, do you mean specifically the price testing integration? Or do you also mean that the Intelligems app embed or like script is in the theme?

>>Gustavo Refosco	23:22
It happens for price test, it happens for shipping as well. For example, when they're trying to use a progress bar, sometimes there's a little bit of friction to get that progress bar live. Or when they go to checkout, unless they have some instructions for us or really read our documentation. Most of these clients don't realize that they need to clean up their cart when they switch test groups in a shipping test or how they are gonna see the intelligence preview rates there, but that intelligence preview is gonna go away when the test is live. So there's sometimes a little bit of confusion around shipping tests as well. Yeah.

>>Angela Wang	24:03
On average, how long are your onboarding calls and how much more shortened would you want them to be like ideally?

>>Gustavo Refosco	24:13
They range from 30 to 60 minutes depends on how much we have to cover. If it's a client that is pretty new to the universe of testing and they're not very familiar with concept and tooling, we can get up to an hour. If it's a client that knows very well what they wanna test, they just want to dive into the integration we did and get a test live together, then it comes down to 30 minutes. So it varies a lot. It depends a lot on the brand.

>>Craig Phillips	24:48
Can you tell from these calls whether the customer is gonna be successful with intelligence or if they're just gonna...

>>Craig Phillips	24:54
Probably give up after a week and never come back? Are there signs?

>>Gustavo Refosco	25:04
Yeah, I think, again, it comes back to the point, if they don't know exactly what they want to test, they get through the kickoff, and a lot of times they don't start a test, and I think these are the clients that churn the most. I don't have data around that, but it's just a feeling that I have. If they don't know what to test, even if the integration is ready, they might just churn. I know we have discussed a lot about, specifically on price testing, when we use duplicate products, there's always a high risk of churn there because there's just so many steps they have to go through to get the duplicate products right, and those are, I always sense, like a little risk of churning unless they really want to test. I have seen clients giving up when it came to configuring the duplicate products. I recently worked with another client that they came to us for a price test. We did integration. We did an entire kickoff call around the price testing. When it came to configure the duplicate products, the client instantly changed and said, oh, I think I don't want to test my prices. I want to test offers, and we had literally 10 minutes left in the kickoff call, so I would say the clients that are not as versed in testing or don't have a plan when they come to us, even if the integration is ready, if we talk to them quickly and have a kickoff call soon, there's still a high risk of churn because now they don't know what to do, I think, with the tool.

>>Craig Phillips	26:33
Nice. All right, we've got a few minutes left.

>>Gustavo Refosco	26:39
Yeah, sorry, guys. I've been rushing through your questions a little because 10 minutes is such a short time. No, it's late.

>>Craig Phillips	26:51
Do you find that, like you mentioned about that case of the price test, and then in the last 10 minutes, they wanted to switch to an offer test. Do you find people come knowing, like how much do they know about what they even can do with intelligence, or is it sort of they're here for this type of test, and you're going to help them get set up, but they have very little understanding of even what else is possible?

>>Gustavo Refosco	27:13
I think they come, it varies by client, but sometimes they come with some expectations on what they can do. Again, for price testing, you can duplicate products. Sometimes it's a bad surprise when they see how much they need to configure there, or for people running content tasks, they think sometimes they come with an expectation that they can just install intelligence and use our editor to move things around and easily set up different styles or different layouts, and it's not as, I guess, user -friendly in that sense if you're not very technical, but also I think it's mostly the greatest difficulties when they really don't know what they should be testing. More than really setting things up, it's when they don't know what they should be testing.

>>Gustavo Refosco	28:13
Sorry, go ahead.

>>Angel Austin	28:15
I was going to say, if we're thinking in terms of activation and retention, based on the calls that you've had, I know it's putting you on the spot, but if you owned Product Roadmap for the next six months or a year, what would you have us work on? What big and small problems would you have us solve?

>>Gustavo Refosco	28:37
I think personally, anything that could be a quick win, like these small details, for example, that little hidden add button and maybe a few other things that just help clients advance to the next step without questioning, what should I do next? Just making sure that whatever they are seeing is really clear. I think if there is any improvements we can do around that that just help them not creating, but really saving a new task and finishing setting it up and then pushing them to set the test live, I think those are the things I would probably focus on. I'm not sure if there's a way to simplify. I know that testing is complex and setting up tests is a complex thing, but a lot of times these users are non -technical, so if there's any way we could simplify the setup process for them, I think that should help them get a test live, maybe quicker. So that's probably what I would focus on.

>>Craig Phillips	29:46
Maybe one quick final question from my side, going back to what you said before,

>>Craig Phillips	29:53
The issue of not knowing whether they're like everything is live and integrated and ready to go how do you uh how do you determine if that's the case like that they are everything's set up like do you have your own sort of checklist that you walk through some of it is technical but some of it is does it has to do with their store

>>Gustavo Refosco	30:14
Like i guess how do you know that that's that they're ready to go um we do have a checklist in onboarding so we try to pair the checklist of tasks we have we also what the client is looking for um So for example if it's a price test we're going to work alongside integrations to get the theme ready So they can get started testing And then um really setting up the test is about deciding which products and price points do the test So i try to focus on those steps with these clients just making sure that they they can decide and get that test um created so we can push that live Um i guess if it's a client running a shipping or accounting test for example um it all depends on what they are looking for with their test um for example shipping the lot of details we have to be mindful about just because of the limitations Shopify offers for example if they want to just test different shipping costs or if they want to test a different threshold uh we have to discuss with them our reward with the fact that we are looking at you know post or pre -discount soup totals things like that so there's a lot of details we have to discuss with these clients before they get their test live And it all depends on what they are aiming at and and also how much flexibility they have to deal with the the technical limitations not necessarily our technical limitations but but Shopify's so i probably deviated a lot on that answer cool um

>>Craig Phillips	31:46
All right well we're we're at time um thank you so much Gustavo for taking i know this was quick and probably had a lot more to say But um But i appreciate you walking us through some of the high high points we might come back with more details on some of these things as we as we go But uh yeah thanks for taking the time perfect

>>Emily Brown	32:05
Uh yeah curious on those other like small items you had on the other tests i don't know if you'd be willing to like send us a loom or something just showing us what those are i think um you know some of us definitely have scope to make small changes in the roadmap after the freeze And so like we definitely want to make sure we get some of those things in as we're working on maybe bigger picture stuff cool

>>Gustavo Refosco	32:32
Uh Yeah I can prepare a list and a loom as well that would be amazing thank you of course

>>Craig Phillips	32:38
Okay thanks Karen have a good night bye
