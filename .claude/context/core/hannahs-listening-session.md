Fall 2025

>>Hannah Patterson	00:00
Angel, is your hair a different color? It is. Yeah? Yeah. It's a little reddish. More red, yeah, Auburn for fall. I like it. It's nice. It's hard to tell where to zoom. I was like, I was wondering the same thing. It's like, is the color a little different? But like, it could just be camera stuff. Yeah.

>>Craig Phillips	00:27
All righty.

>>Hannah Patterson	00:37
I am ready to get started. I don't know if anyone else will join. Cool.

>>Craig Phillips	00:42
I think just Emily, but yeah, we can, I think go ahead and get started. Cool.

>>Hannah Patterson	00:48
Sounds good. I have like a little deck put together with what I think are like strengths and weaknesses of all of those ones that are in the videos, but definitely down to make this like more conversational. I think pretty much everyone has watched all the videos. So I'm sure you guys all have opinions on what they're doing well, what they're not doing well, what like we could be doing more like them or less like them, things that like we're doing better than them. So yeah, definitely down to chat through all of that. As far as like the ones that I picked, the way that I thought about it was really like Shopify native versus not Shopify native. And then within that, the not Shopify native ones are harder to really like get an eye on because you have to have a business email in order to get in there. So like Vwo, optimizelyconvert .com, you have to use a business email from what I've seen. And I do not have a business email created. I have not gone that deep into my burner creation. So maybe eventually, but I didn't have that right now. So the ones that I did look at were mostly Shopify native, Shoplift, Visually, AP Convert, and Absolutely. And then Personizely is one that is not limited to Shopify only. They are on the Shopify app, but they are the one that can be used across like other platforms as well from what I saw.

>>Kate White	02:22
I have a, I'm just realizing, I have an email I could use probably for those. So maybe I'll do a similar to you and just walk through before next week.

>>Hannah Patterson	02:32
Yeah, that would be awesome. And then the one other thing I like took into account when I was picking them, I was mostly going for ones that do do some level of price testing, just because I think those are like the closest competitors to us. So searching on the app store, looking at like what came up there and what had more than 20 reviews basically. So those were a lot of the big ones that seemed like true competitors and not like some sort of dynamic pricing with only two reviews type of situation. Cool.

>>Craig Phillips	03:03
Hannah, do you know from the few that we watched, I'm just curious like competitors that we're like losing business to potentially, like we hear Shoplift, we hear Visually, we hear Vwo, we hear Optimizely, maybe Ab Convert. Absolutely was a new one that I hadn't heard of, but that doesn't mean much. I'm curious if there are any of these that like bubble to the top in terms of like competitors were actually like, you know, our customers are going to them or choosing them over us, you know.

>>Hannah Patterson	03:36
Shoplift and Visually are the ones that I hear the most often, particularly like when I was in onboarding, those were the ones that I heard come up the most often. I think Ab Convert and Convert .com, Optimizely, Vwo, those all come up a bit as well, but are definitely like very focused on the content side. Absolutely was new for me. And then Helen actually flagged Personizely for me, which I'm not sure, where did you see that one come up, Helen?

>>Helen Keighron	04:02
Anna Churn, somebody wrote in and they asked, Personizely, it almost looks like they intentionally ripped us, like a lot of what Intelligems does and even like how we're set up to some degree, but the person was like, why should I pay $700 a month Vwo when I could go use Personizely? And so that was an interesting discussion. He ended up not going to Personizely, he ended up going to Shoplift in the end. Cool.

>>Hannah Patterson	04:34
Sweet. I don't know why my image isn't loading there, all it is is the Shoplift logo. So not a big deal, but that is weird. Couple of things that I looked at to start were like just kind of company overview. One thing that was very interesting to me was a lot of these competitors started in like 2022. Good majority of them did start after us, which is just kind of interesting to me. So.

>>Hannah Patterson	04:58
It seems like maybe they were a bit aligned with the Google Optimize sunsetting, but I thought that was interesting. And then pricing was also very interesting to take a look at across all of these. Almost every single one had some level of three plans that were pretty closely associated with our three plans. So some level of core type of content testing, bit more limited, advanced, which included everything on core, plus things like price testing, maybe some of their other more advanced features, like that lift assist that we saw in Shoplift. And then pro, which most of the pro accounts came with, it was really more about like the services. What did you get as far as account management? Less as far as just like more actual app features. So interesting to see that. Couple of them were based on visitors instead of orders, which I think is interesting as well. I feel like we've heard a lot of feedback that customers actually don't like that as much because if you have a really low conversion rate, you can be paying a ton for testing, but really not getting all that much out of it. So interesting to see that. Pretty much everything came with 14 day trials. I didn't see, I don't think anything below that. And then as far as pricing for Shoplift, their monthly pricing started at 99 and 399. And then pro was only available on annual and it's scaled with visitor volume. So pretty comparable on the pricing there, I would say. And then as far as strengths and weaknesses on Shoplift, I think overall Shoplift's like main strength is just being like really easy to use.

>>Hannah Patterson	06:43
The platform feels, I would say like very modern. They do a lot of their stuff like directly within the Shopify theme customizer. They really like drive you to do your stuff through templates and just get into Shopify templates and make those changes there. Their lift assist, like Ai powered automation, auto creates things that then go within templates. So they're very focused on like keeping people in what they know and making that edit process really easy. They also claim superior performance and technical quality. Obviously I didn't have a great way to truly test that, but definitely something that people are always concerned about. So having that be like at the forefront is interesting, even if they didn't have necessarily a way to prove it. And then I thought their analytics were very like aesthetically pleasing. They included like visuals of the test groups there, hypothesis, timelines. So they looked really nice. And then they also do that single page scroll design, which I think Craig, you maybe commented on as well. It just feels like really modern and easy to navigate. You don't feel like you're like missing any steps in that process. And then as far as weaknesses, I would say like very limited testing capabilities. They really only had the three types of content tests, which was like theme, template and URL. And price testing was in beta. So I didn't really get to check that out very well because I wasn't going to submit a request for that. Limited rollout capabilities. When you roll out with them, it's really just like implementing those variants within Shopify. So it's not necessarily allowing you to like target in any way like we do. I thought their analytics were relatively shallow.

>>Hannah Patterson	08:24
It was like very focused on top of funnel metrics and like broad segments. You couldn't really like dig deeper from what I could see. And then I think this number four is like the most interesting to me. They do not do multivariant testing. You cannot do more than like two test groups that control in one test group, which I thought was super interesting. And I'm just really surprised that that doesn't come up more often when people talk about Shoplift. And then overall, just not like a comprehensive platform. They didn't have any other capabilities outside of AB testing.

>>Emily Brown	08:57
I've definitely seen more sophisticated users and larger brands come to us because of the lack, from Shoplift because of the lack of multivariant testing. I think maybe we're not aware that this is such a key feature of ours. So we don't bring it up. I'm glad Matt mentioned table stakes.

>>Hannah Patterson	09:15
Yeah,

>>Emily Brown	09:16
But yeah, that is a thing for certain users. But you have to know that it, like the user has to know it's a thing in order for them to.

>>Hannah Patterson	09:25
Yeah, yeah. They have to know that other platforms are doing that. Cool. Any other like things that other people noticed outside of this? I'm also on my small screen. So I can't see you guys as a forewarning.

>>Craig Phillips	09:49
You can hear this. Yeah, like, I think my, yeah, like it felt like easy to use.

>>Craig Phillips	09:57
Modern, nice, but yet it didn't feel like it had the depth. I think back to what Matt was saying, is that if our customers are coming because there's a certain understanding of power and sophistication that they get with our tool, they wouldn't get it there. It's interesting, you said the price, so the price point is about the same between like, with us and them, it's not a huge difference.

>>Hannah Patterson	10:16
Yeah.

>>Craig Phillips	10:18
Yeah, so.

>>Hannah Patterson	10:19
It's a little hard to relate just because of the visitor situation. It's like, okay, it is 99. Yeah, it really depends on like, what someone's conversion rate is.

>>Craig Phillips	10:30
Yeah. I'd be curious, and then maybe like, once we get through all of these, and this comes up, I was just chatting with Emily before, but that multivariant testing came up as like a differentiator for us, like feature -wise. Like I wonder, I think it doesn't have to be for now, but like later, what are the other things that we have that these don't have? Like I think, Emily, you've called out like the custom code, like the JavaScript injection and things like that. I don't know if they have any kind of custom code stuff, but I didn't notice it.

>>Hannah Patterson	11:02
Yeah, they don't have like a true on -site editor. Their lift assist is like the closest thing to that, and it's like, still a little different because you're still doing a majority of that in templates, not within like code injection.

>>Craig Phillips	11:16
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's just something in the back of my mind is like, what are those like differentiators that maybe we don't always talk about, or at least I don't always think about that we might keep in mind as we think about, you know, new ways to design things. So anyway, that's it for me.

>>Hannah Patterson	11:36
Cool. Oh, did anyone else have anything?

>>Angela Wang	11:40
I did notice like also the aesthetically pleasing, like in general, there was a heavy use of illustration that didn't really, like you didn't need any text to help support that. It was very obvious of what those components or whatever they were trying to display was. So I thought that was really nice because it was just like a first glance, like understanding of what you're getting yourself into.

>>Hannah Patterson	12:03
Yeah, I like too how some of their visuals were just like general visuals. They weren't trying to like pull in screenshots of the brand itself, because I think like we do that quite a bit and we run into issues with it. It doesn't always work perfectly. Sometimes we get the wrong page or the screenshot's just wrong, but it was like just as helpful to just see a mocked up version of something. Cool. Next one up is visually, which I did not have a video in there. I just got into Angela's account yesterday. I was a little more cautious with this one, just given that they've not been our biggest fans in the past. So I do have a video that I can share with you guys. It was one that Adam took if anyone's interested in it, and also happy to take a video. But yeah, they were also founded in 2022. And then plan -wise, they were a bit interesting. When you were doing a smaller number of visitors, you got two options. You got the pro plan and the launch. And then once you hit a certain point, or no, you got the pro and the scale, sorry. I listed these the way that it showed up. So you got the pro and the scale. And then once you went over 5 ,000 orders, you suddenly got this launch plan, but it wasn't clear what the differences were in those plans, which I just thought was very interesting. I think being clear about your pricing and your packaging is so important. So it was just interesting to see. And then all of their plans came with 14 -day trials as well. And their monthly pricing for their pro plan was really low.

>>Hannah Patterson	13:45
It started at $15, which is kind of crazy. And then the scale plan was definitely on the more expensive side. So just interesting pricing to see compared to the other ones I was looking at. Cool. As far as strengths go, I think the one thing that Visually does incredibly well is their in -app preview is very, very slick. You can set things up. You can drag and drop things into there. They give you just a really nice Ui to design these different elements. If you guys haven't seen Visually, as much as we maybe don't like them, it is very impressive and really can't knock them for what they've done there. So super cool to see that. A couple of other things they do well, they have a very robust audience builder that you can then save and use that to view the data or seamlessly add those audience to test later on, which I know is something that we've talked about doing. And I think that was just a really nice Ui that they've built for that. Their educational content in the app is also really, really solid. They have like 30 minutes.

>>Hannah Patterson	14:56
30 plus inspirational use cases that then you can easily read, click into, then immediately set it up. They do a really good job of surfacing relevant help docs when it makes sense and having in -app video explaining how to do things. Just really good at pointing people in those directions. They have unique modification options that I really didn't see across any of the other apps I was looking at. Things like fake clicks, product upsells, post -purchase pages. Not really seeing that on any of the other competitors. And then also just a really simple setup flow. Ask you a question on whether you want to run it as a test or an experience at the end of the setup. So they just port you into that really well. I know one thing we've talked about is our customers don't know the difference between the two. They don't know when they should be using what. And they just set this up really well that you do all of your modifications and then get ported into that. And then as far as weaknesses, their price testing sophistication, they only have it available to Shopify Plus And they don't appear to have support for more complex situations like subscriptions. I imagine like multi -currency as well also couldn't really get in there because of the Shopify Plus limitation. And then the one thing about the in -app editor, I did feel like it was like a bit buggy. I think part of that could have been because we're on a password -protected store, but I couldn't get it working really well. I did talk to Carolyn then after I made this deck and part of it was me just not understanding the Ui. You had to like hover on things for a while before, and when I say a while, I mean like five to 10 seconds before you got the plus sign to actually add new elements.

>>Hannah Patterson	16:37
I thought their onsite preview was like pretty buggy. I couldn't get that to work consistently either, which obviously we also hear that all the time. So interesting to see that that's maybe a bit of a consistent experience across apps. There's got to be a way to do it better, but interesting to just see that that was consistent. And then I thought this was a bit of a weakness. Maybe it's me just not being in a true, oh, was that a hand?

>>Helen Keighron	17:06
No, I just dropped a link to their AI demo.

>>Hannah Patterson	17:09
Oh, sweet. Cool. Yeah, they like force you into launching a test immediately or scheduling it. It's not super obvious how you would like save it as a draft, which I just feel like so many of our customers will come in and set stuff up that then they like want to launch manually at a later date. So not having that obvious was a little weird to me. And then I also thought their analytics was pretty basic. I think we'll see that as a consistent trend across all of these competitors. I think our dashboard is like insane how much more robust it is compared to these competitors. Most of them have like one page with maybe what we have on the key metrics page, but they might not even go that deep. So I do think that's like a huge grow of Intelligems that we could probably lean into a bit more. Cool. Any other thoughts on visually that I missed? Sweet. I'll keep moving given the time.

>>Hannah Patterson	18:22
Sweet. Next one is Abconvert also started in 2022. So like I said, something definitely kicked off in 2022 that people were jumping on this space. Also had three plans, very similar, basic, advanced, and plus pretty much the exact same layout as Shoplift and very similar to us as well. Their pricing, I would say, started a bit cheaper. It started at $79, $149, and $249. Actually, no, theirs is just those prices. It did not scale with order or visitor volume at all. So definitely like a very cheap solution. I'm kind of surprised we aren't hearing about these guys more just given that they are so cheap and that they don't scale at all with order or visitor volume. So it will be interesting to hear them come up more. They also, I would say, had the most robust options, which we'll talk about here more. They had checkout. They had shipping. They had pricing. So better than, I would say, Visually or Shoplift on that front. They had checkout. And they also had some unique checkout testing options. Kate, I know you And I had talked about this at one point, but they also have like payment and delivery customizations, which are available to people not on Shopify Plus, which is just a great way to, I think, get some of those people who are on Shopify Advanced or Shopify Basic into that type of testing world. So I thought that was cool.

>>Hannah Patterson	19:55
They had more robust template testing as well. They had like cart templates, blog templates, search and page templates, which we are limited to homepage, collection, product. I think we have one more just like page type, I think. So interesting to see that they had expanded there. They were one that had the unique framing of the price testing integration. So basically you go and you set up a price test. They say, great, that's saved. Our team is gonna do a theme check that will take one to two days and we'll let you know when it's ready, which I imagine is them just going in and doing the integration at that point. But there's interesting the way that they like frame that. I do think that's possibly like a strength and a weakness. I think as a customer, if that wasn't super clear upfront, that might frustrate me a bit. But also knowing that the alternative is not realizing that there's an integration, maybe that is a positive way to frame it and kind of control that situation. They also had some proactive checks for whether you'd be able to access certain features. One that I saw was the third -party rate carrier Api, which is what we and they use for shipping testing. And they basically had me go through a check to confirm that I had access to that before I was even able to set up a shipping test, which I thought was pretty cool because the way that we do it right now is we don't tell someone until they either, I'm not sure if it's when they create a test or try to start a shipping test, but regardless, it's very late in the game that we tell them, actually, you can't do this.

>>Emily Brown	21:30
So, yeah, I would tell people that part. When I was demoing to everyone, my store didn't have it And I didn't know until the very end.

>>Hannah Patterson	21:40
Yeah, Yeah, It's a little like frustrating to get through all of that and then be like, Oh wait, I actually can't do this. So Yeah, I really liked that. Cool, they also did the single page scroll design similar to Shoplist, just felt very modern, easy to navigate, couldn't miss any of the steps because they were all on one page and you only have to scroll in one direction to catch everything. And they also did a really good job with the educational content, pulling it in, making sure that it was surfaced as people needed it. Cool, and then on the weakness side, their targeting capabilities were very limited. There was really no way to set up more sophisticated segments or any sophisticated ruling where you would say, if someone matches XYZ, make sure they're in this test group. If they match Abc, put them in this other test group. So some limitations there that I think some of our more sophisticated customers would not like. They also had no preview for most types of tests. So you really just had to launch things and hope for the best, which would terrify me and very surprising that they didn't have any solution for that. Similar to the other two, very basic analytics dashboards, just very limited in what data they had in there. Decent use of duplicate product usage. It seemed like that's how they do their price testing from what I was able to tell. And then another category of testing they had was what they called Pdp testing, where you would get into this editor. I worked through it in the video, but you could change the title and the images and stuff like that. But it turned out what they did was basically just use that information that you plug in to then go create a duplicate product and then just do a URL redirect between the two.

>>Hannah Patterson	23:29
So kind of a cool way to have people set that up. But knowing our customers, I think a lot of people would be very against the duplicate product usage there. Anyway, just an interesting way to frame it. And then also not a comprehensive platform, no capabilities outside of A -B testing, no personalization or site -wide analytics or anything like that. Cool. Any comments on A -B convert? I know I only have a couple minutes left.

>>Angel Austin	23:59
One thing I love that they did is they started on the test creation flow with their hypothesis. Yeah, that was such great storytelling and we're also educating. If we mirrored something like that, we're also teaching them really good practice with the scientific method and how we're supposed to test. Actually, that was really smart.

>>Hannah Patterson	24:18
Yeah.

>>Helen Keighron	24:19
They do actually have preview, but it's kind of hidden. You have to go to the summary modal after you've got the test set up and then there's little eyes. And depending on the type of test, it looks like this is different too. There's not a single way to preview things. They move it around and hide it and stuff.

>>Hannah Patterson	24:35
Okay, interesting. Yeah, I could not find a way to do it.

>>Helen Keighron	24:39
Weird pattern.

>>Hannah Patterson	24:40
Yeah. I wonder if part of that is certain types of tests they don't preview well. Maybe their shipping tests don't preview well for some reason. Yeah. Super weird. I feel like a lot of our customers.

>>Hannah Patterson	24:54
Do you care about preview, but it's like not necessarily at the top of their mind, which I think is interesting, too I like can't imagine launching tests without going through a QA But maybe that's the best practice we need to train on more to cool Potentially lean into as a differentiator.

>>Emily Brown	25:14
Yeah, this might be a Thing

>>Hannah Patterson	25:18
Yeah Cool. I think this is my last one. Yeah, it's cool So personally like I mentioned at the beginning this was the one that is not Shopify only they integrated with I think the two big ones they mentioned was Wix and Wordpress and also the only one that Started before us back in 2018. So a little bit older of a platform Which is interesting that we haven't really heard about them a ton given that They only offer two plans to which I thought was somewhat interesting They don't really lean into the account management services side of things. So really more similar to just our core and our plus Essential which comes with things like URL and theme testing and then premium which comes with those But then also all other types of content testing and price testing So essential is almost a little bit more like our core redirect and then premium is a little bit more like our plus They almost switch over or jump over our our core plan, I guess And then their pricing is really low which it sounds like is what came up in that turn that Helen was talking about they start at 39 and 59 and They scale with visitor volume Yeah, definitely a cheaper option here as far as strengths go they do really Position themselves as like an all -in -one Cro suite they Had a pretty strong suite of things like pop -ups and other models that you could could plug into your website They had a be testing personalization all in this like single platform Their in -app editor was also somewhat strong I would say very like embedded in there I would say it wasn't super intuitive is it like a first -time user?

>>Hannah Patterson	27:05
But I think was one of the most user -friendly options in the market I think if you got in there and started playing around with it, it would come to you very easily Very comprehensive widget variety Like I said, they had pop -ups call -outs bars and beds and they were extremely seamless to integrate All I had to do was like set up the customization within the app And then it immediately showed up on the website without me doing Anything else which was really cool Um Campaign set up for tests and personalization. They had those like more seamlessly integrated. I think Craig you commented on the video They like bundled those into the two and the very first thing you did when you were setting up a test was do you want to set up a Test or personalization and then you went through the rest of the steps, which was cool to see I think something that like we still need to to grasp and part of what this project is about So it's cool to see an example of that Um Targeting was Insanely robust they had like 18 plus rules They had saved audience. You could also allocate less than 100 % of your traffic to a test. So have like a holdout group Which is something we get asked for by some of our more Advanced users so cool to see someone already doing that And very strong platform integrations They had like 20 plus third -party integrations and they surface those all right up front in the like very first download flow Cool, and then on the weakness side price testing sophistication another one that was limited to Shopify Plus I think potentially used duplicate products, but it could have been functions And didn't have support for more complex situations Profit testing as a whole was pretty limited.

>>Hannah Patterson	28:47
They didn't have shipping offer or checkout. They were like very focused on the content and the price No multivariant on like your initial setup you had to go through and create your test And then you were allowed to add additional test groups, which I thought was Interesting. I think like that would annoy me a little bit as a customer another one basic analytics The editor complexity I mentioned that like it was a nice Ui But there were some reviews that noted it was like tricky to edit different elements I think that's probably similar to our query selector issue. Just one of those those things um And then stepper for setup. I think that's what Helen was referencing as far as them kind of just ripping us off and Really no education in the app Which was interesting to see too Cool. I know it was a lot in 30 minutes Anything on personalized person eyes Lee. I still wouldn't call it personalized Lee Helen. I think they should really have a

>>Helen Keighron	29:51
Yeah I mean I

>>Helen Keighron	29:53
Do we have any I don't know how hard it is to make a Shopify plus burner like I think you said it was like a little bit expensive, but like we might want to do it for like a month because they actually do use Css selectors for their price testing like I went through their docs a while ago, and I was like Oh interesting So like I would love to see how they handle that that part like that integration piece But yeah,

>>Hannah Patterson	30:14
I think we can't go in and I think we could just pay for one month, and I think it's $3 .99 for your first month Might be worth it, especially if there's other ones where there's things that we would want to see for plus.

>>Helen Keighron	30:25
I don't know Yeah

>>Hannah Patterson	30:26
Yeah, it could be worth just doing a sprint looking at like every single experience on Shopify plus and maybe Cool, this was this was awesome.

>>Helen Keighron	30:35
Yeah

>>Hannah Patterson	30:40
Sweet I will see you all later. Thanks
