Me: All the pipes kind of on data, so basically. You would enable your GA and your Facebook pixel. Like all your pixels you could have managed by LR and LVR would make sure that you have the latest pixel and ascending on the data correctly. If you wanted to fire custom events, you set the custom event up once in Livar and then you tell it which pixels to fire it to. It would fire that custom event to all those things. And it was analytics and the management of data and also. On ecom sites specifically for sites. So it was basically just like making sure all of the data was healthy. If you will. There's probably that's, like, roughly what it was. Jericho was like, I think first technical support and moved into a technical product manager role when we got introduced to lr. Jericho is new in this technical product manager role. The question was, how can one of our customers. Propagate which test group someone is in to all the different analytics platforms that they use. So I copied Jupyter said we wanted to go through all of our and if you have this integration with Alivar, then literally you press a button in Livar and then all the test group assignments from the user get propagated. So then you can filter in Google Analytics. Like people who saw this variant and people saw this variant. And so that was our first partnership. Jerka was my counter, like I was. No one else worked here. So I worked with Jerica, like, setting up that integration. And she was like, well, he could do this, but there'd be these upsides, and it would be easy, but there'll be these trade offs. We can do this. We can do this. And so she and I work together on, figuring out how does the integration between Intelligems and all of our work. And how they can set it. And she was just super knowledgeable, very. Clearly how everything worked really well and also very. Had good judgment. On where the right trade offs were being made to make it work. And then she wrote up like a whole doc and she hears a doc that we're going to publish an art in our docs, like let me know. Great. This is amazing. This woman in Jerica is like the doll is work for us. Cool. And then fast forward two years or three years. Livar had acquired. I don't think it was, like, great outcome was fine. And we reached out to her proactively, being like, maybe the fact that you're an acquired means role. And she was like, yes, I'm looking for a role. We made her an offer. I think we were. Like this was before Helen was here. And so we didn't really have a very clear product structure or team or, like, what her role would be, like you and we want here. And she ended up taking on a different role. And no bad blood. It might. Her husband is A.J. okay, I did know that. Yeah. Okay, so after she turned this down, she was like. And by the way, if you're open to it, A day who is also at Elivar. And he and I are married, so they work together at. Okay. And. She's like, I think he would be great here. And then he interviewed and hired AJ I think he was newish when I started, too. Yeah. And fast forward then another year. She? AJ's like, Jared is not happy in the role that she took. Would you be, like, open to reconsidering her for something on the product team, as you were a year ago? This was like, back in, like, August, and I was like, listen. I have, like, all these new people. In NBC. I really am not 100% sure what your role would be to kind of see how all this stuff. Pans out. I was like, also, maybe. I was a little bit trying to manage. Just like. Growing the team, getting out of our skis, and just, like, making sure we had a clear role for everyone. And so we kind of, like, kicked the can from August until now, and I was like, okay. Every time we were in a conversation, we're like, we need more work on, like, third party APIs per ecosystem. I was like, this is a kind of old jerk. It would be like, perfect. And that's, like, always. What? You kind of like mine? Was like, my first international hair four years ago. I was like, Scoping out how this, like, integration between these two things would work and that she wrote up a doc on it that's, like, super clean and, like, easy to understand and follow. Cool. I think that's very much, like, aligned with the. The role here, and so I think it's a really good fit. Anyway. That sounds. I also think, like, part of what. I also think that she, she, Jerka and Hannah have a very similar, like, career path, which is, like, started in support, understood the product really well. Have good product instincts and a good sense of trade offs. And like transitioning the product roles. And so that's where, like, to me, makes sense, that, like, your background in a more traditional product, like, background. Can help fill some of those gaps for that. Yeah. Perfect. And, I mean, I made the transition from. I mean, no one has a classic product. Background. Right. But I yeah, same thing like engineering to product and did that at customer IO. So yeah, I've also been similar spots that they have. I think my biggest questions and not for to answer right now, but I will want to get a lot more context around your vision and thoughts for this ecosystem. Pillar. Just in general, like, in order to help guide dirt. I mean, I know there's going to be a lot of onboarding for her anyway, but to just kind of help. Be able to help guide that in whatever way I can. Yeah, we can cook, create. I haven't even written down the omic ars yet, but that's. We can co create that if you want. That'd be awesome. Yeah. Cool. Okay? I don't know if. What we are expecting. Hannah. Back or not? You want to talk, let's talk quickly. We just. Check hands down. And see if she's coming back. Or not. No, she's like an angel, okay? All right. I'm going to. Paint. Each other. Okay? I. Have lots of pieces. Working. Through some more, kind of. Sensitive stuff. But. They don't have. Sure. I can also. Make it work. All right. Let's go back to. Let's look at the stock you shared with me. We also. Hel. En is crushing. It. She said she had them, like, stacked up. Today. Okay? I'm going to be really. If I. If I am seemingly. What? The fuck does the word. I don't. Know. I should know. Like. Particular. Or. Like a pendant. What? Do you think this is? Long vents or too pedantic? Great appeal. Okay? I don't know what I mean. Man, if I. 'm getting caught up in my word choice. It's because I think, like, I want to come back to these on a biweekly basis and, like, so I want this to. To hold. This is the first, by the way, that I'm, like, actually thinking critically about. About this. So I'm also, like, doing a little bit, like, on the fly. I agree with this experience. I did a launch. I worry. Is it too narrow? Oh, man, yeah, yeah. Is it like what's now about to me is like. Just. Set up. Yeah. Experience idea to launch is exactly. It's just like. What about after launch? Right? Like what happens in that moment once it's live or you come back for the analytics or like what up beyond just experiences? Like what? How do we think about like what is what? Is. Oh, I'm thinking okay. I don't know. Speaking of words, I think. I'm thinking objective. This was an objective for the strategic initiative, which was. Well, no, it's. You called it core experiences, but I feel like the focus is on experience setup. Is that wrong? No. I mean, maybe the Q1 focus is. Depends on how long it takes, and maybe it's even two quarters. My intention of calling it Core Experience is like anything that lots of people touch. So, for example. And like, there should there. There will be things that have, like, overlap with other pillars, potentially. But, for example. Share links for analytics to me is like that is part of that course. It's like getting more people to view the results of a test is a core experience. Yeah. So it may be like. Like, I think the thing that needs the most work is like the on site editor and like set up. But, like, I. I'm thinking that this is broader than that. It's just like, what are the things that lots of people touch at high frequency? Another potential example might be like, if we were like, hey, we want to get. More of these workflows into slack. How does that look like? And it's not. It's like, at intelligence. How is my thing work? Like, how's my experiment running? Or can you, like, pause this? I don't know. Got it. Yeah. Okay, then that is definitely too narrow. I was thinking about. Yeah, it was. Too objective. He needs the right objective for the first quarter. But should objectives be at the pillar level and for the year? I think so. I don't know. No, I think. I think they should. I think objective objectives should not change quarterly, in my opinion. Great. Okay, I'll rethink that one. Are you continuing on the fly? I mean, I think. A version of this that we've had in the past is like, make intelligence. Intuitive. Or simple, intuitive. And delightful. To use. Or something like that. I mean, this is. This was like a different objective for a different reason, but, like. Simple being like. I think we have a pancita over complicated intuitive meaning. Like, there's, like. Unintuitive user experiences. That's related to simple, but it's, like, slightly different and delightful. Is like, actually hurt me, like, solicit joy. And like. I mean, that feels like it should be a product principle. Maybe in general, like, across everyone, but therefore it's not specific enough to experiences. But. Like, for me, the remove friction is kind of like, Yep, yep. I like removing friction. It's kind of like. Although when we start talking like. But even when we narrow it into, like, usability, intuitiveness, we're not talking anymore about, like, yeah, sending messages to Slack and getting. That's more the business goals that our users have in mind. Yeah, maybe another framing here is like, in the, like, value effort ratio, this is about the effort half of the equation. Not the value. So it's not like we are creating more value for you here. Realize the value. It's that make me like reduce dramatically reduce the effort to achieve that. That's exactly what my husband's about to go. Because I think you even said it. And they. When we were talking about the initiative, You said something about, like, this is how they realized the value of the product. Yeah. Yeah. What? It. What did I say? What? What did I say? How do people use intelligence and understand Understand the value. I like to understand our value. Understand our value and achieve our value. Yeah, it's like realize the value. And that encapsulates intuitive, easy, simple. If they can't. Okay? So make the highest volume experiences simple and delightful, helping customers effortlessly understand and achieve value. So highest volume is like, that's where we narrow it. And I'm like, hey, it's not going to be this, like, I don't know. Random thing or like, so it's, it's not the horizon. Two stuff, like, basically, to me, This is, like, very squarely horizon line, as I think about, like, have you heard me? Like, which is where the word comes from. Core. That's why you're like, core. Exactly. It's like if Verizon 3 is the stuff that no one is using and this is, like, kind of a moonshot. That Horizon 2 is like, some people are using this. We are optimistic about its value, but it's like, how do we scale this to, like, millions of dollars in revenue? And Horizon 1 is like, what's the stuff that is, like, generating millions of dollars already? And how do we get even, like, better? And so like to me. So the narrowing here is the highest the volume experiences. Simply delightful. Coming up, effortlessly understanding the cheap value. It seems like a pretty ambitious. But, like, doable, objective. Yeah. Yep. Great. Okay? Now the krs should be quarter right. Yeah, I think so. I mean, these most target extent before the first quarter, okay? Because some of these in here, and you can see in my little notes, it's like, I don't think we can make meaningful progress on this in one quarter, but. I think that with anything on the product side, you especially. One challenge, and this is like, According to my Granola wrapped. Like, where how imbalances me out is like, I have this, like. Boundless optimism and, like, yeah, oversimplified dislike. Could we do this, like, in half a day? And then Helen was like, okay. Pause. Like, let's think about this. And, like, practical here. So. I get that, like, we need to do a food process, and, like, that process is probably longer for things that require more. Diligence and research in my thought. And we should probably apply more diligence and research and thought the things that are, like, the most core. So like, yes, yes, and yes. Which means that maybe we aren't able to tremendously impact outcomes in Q1. However. Yeah. However, we should impact something in Q1. I'm definitely not suggesting that, but as my like, some of these have been underway. In my We've been thinking about this since before. Like. Trying to find time with Craig. And he. He goes, great. I sent the time for tomorrow and I didn't see it. And I didn't see it. Like any time this week or next week. I was like, maybe he didn't invite me. So it did crack down and didn't see it. So it's like, Craig, if you. I don't know. I didn't see it. He was like, oh, stupid. From March 24th. That's a good day. Yeah. I don't know. Vacation or something. Real far. Out. I was like my calendar. My gun is like that. Empty. You're probably looking to go wrong. I'm hopeful the other like push and this may apply less to core experiences. Both in scope and mandate, but also. In like the types of initiatives, well, scrolling mandate and also like this. One push as we, like, think about what are, like, some of the most, like, the most important objectives that we can, like, think about and focus on as a company. And, like, I would say K did this, like, What she was pushing on was like, there's always a decade ago, all these kids still operate. What is, like, the one thing that's not actually, she said, I think there's, like, one thing that we should all, as a company anchor to. That One thing is first 90 day gross revenue retention. And I am inclined to agree with her. That was one of the key results. Objective 1.1. Like one wasn't like, create more value. Key result number one was improve tension. So, like, retention is was like the first key result of the first objective. And like, that is how I feel about it. That was, like, intentional. At first I thought she was trying to push for. That to be the, like, what's all swarm and, like, think about that metric. And I was like, There is just so much that goes into retention and like, and it is the lackiest of indicators and like, the products that we are doing is going to, like, have a long lead time before that. She was like. Actually, what I was thinking was, like, first time gay retention. And. I. I maybe like from people said it differently. Can we, as a company aim to. And I think this is unrealistic, obviously, but, like, can we aim to retain every customer that installs us after January? Like someone installs us, we like fight tooth and nail to try and retain it. And that is like there are all these different channels that we acquire customers, sales and self serve and partnership led. There's different flows that we go through for onboarding. Some will talk you through success, some are through like product led, whatever. So this is a super cross functional effort. On this product front. I think that, like, this is a big focus of Emily using, like, onboarding, activation, like, getting them to be successful. If you're that whole flow. I don't know. So anyway, that is like, something like so. I. I think that that is a worthy company wide focus. How can we improve that? Agreed. Again. I don't. The role this has in that is like all of those people who. Work of the failure mode like tried to set up their first test and failed. That is like. That's, I would say, the biggest opportunity. Here. Agreed. And so. I think there's, like, I. Love onsite edited tickets. I think there's, like, something around, like, success rate. Creation. Yeah. It's kind of what the abandoned was supposed to be. It's framed negatively. Yeah, but, like, if you're. We can invert it. But that's. Yeah, that's decreasing success because. Yeah, same thing. Yeah, exactly. I wonder if it makes sense to. No, I don't think so. I was going to say it doesn't make sense to make that even more narrow and stay focused on. Self serve people that were focused on first experience? I don't think so. Yeah, I don't either. I mean, I think Emily. Yeah, for sure. Exactly. That was definitely like. But I think these. We have that focus. We should be like, if it's your second, if it's your third, if you're trying to get to that. Yeah. If you're trying to go twice around. The flywheel. It should be easy as the first. Okay, so, okay. In the doc, right? Yeah, I'm typing. Okay. Increase experience creation success rate. This is like. From beginning to, like, there's, like, two complexes. From beginning to create the experience to saving it. Successfully, right? Like, just, like, getting through the flow. Sure? Because you may, like, bail halfway through. And then there's like. From a successfully created experience watching it. And you might not watch it if you felt like. It wasn't working. Yeah, like, confidence. You weren't sure if it was working. Like, that's where, like, previewing and feeling, like, good about it working comes in. Benchmark both of these. And then. I like the on site editor tickets. One. All right. What? 's your. If we said there was like, five. A week. That's roughly tracking that number, the ticket, maybe four. Weeks. Look, what's your. I bet it's more than that, actually. It's too bad that it's probably just a data tracking issue. Yeah, it's a little bit hard to. I don't you hear that number from. No, I just, like, went and found the tag. I don't know how diligent our team is with tags. Yeah, I think. I think, like. You could probably be more inclusive with tags. Like, for example, Image replacements is probably related is like something that would also is a separate tag. But it's like I also felt like there were probably way more because there were way more snippets alone in. Like I or poc ing another product feedback tool right now. So I dumped the last 30 days of Pylon tickets in the last five months of attention calls in there. And it identified 119 mentions. Of onset onsite editor previewing issues and yeah, same. I hadn't even expanded that to like image replacement or any even content editing. We have ways of getting better numbers there. Yeah. It was a super quick grab. Oh, karen. Just. Drop. Ped the nose. She was like, that was not. What I think. Yeah. These are these. So these key results. I like them so far are all very focused on experience, creation. Is there anything else? That we think is, like, representative of. Lower effort. Like, let's say I like this concept of, like, if we were anchor on lower effort. How can we measure things at low effort? Maybe just like a component of time. You don't have time. It takes. So this is success rate. So we could also potentially be one around. Like time. Yeah. I mean. That's always. Just begins to be so hard to measure. Yeah. And like, if someone schedules from create experience to start experience. It's the success rate and also the speed at which you can go in. I don't know. Stippling here for sure. I threw the components in there only because obviously part of our work is, like, that was working actually backwards. Great, great, great, great, great. I overlooked that increase. Pretending I have a lot of components focusing right now. On. What is 5%? That's 5% of active accounts have live components. What are you the primary component that are quantity button. Yeah, it's all the offers ones. Right now it's actually not including checkout because we just forgot to put that in mixed panel. It was happening at the exact same time we were getting org data in, so we got to fix that with engineering to get. Better. What if we were to look at. We have it somewhere. Yeah, we have it. In general, the live components. One, though, is like. Not really. Directly related to simple, delightful. Effortlessly understanding and achieving value, but. Is very related to. Just like I like it, the components product. Great. But you've seen this. Yeah. I didn't think there was anything specific to components in there. There's offers, first of all. There's cross product in December common. So this field goes back to 16 is app. You can tell there's two building started data set back then. But the answer is like the number of tests like this has come. I saw it in like every data set I was looking at. So I was like, oh, this is probably pretty common. Yeah. Very common. But look at these cross product adoption metrics. We're like all time highs right now. For, like. Partial weekends this week. So. That's pretty cool. I can show you what we do have in Migs Town. Oh, wait. I was going to say. I'm sorry. I got distracted. Check out block. So 2.1% checkout block. So this is based on, like, them being active? Yeah. So I think mix panel. Yeah. I've been trying to do the same, though. We have the data? Kind of. Yeah. Hannah and I have a call with. This is definitely better than my channel. I'm definitely not trying to. Yeah, it's just hard to use. Yeah, it's easier for us to just, like, get a trend in mixed panel, but anyway. We do have, and Hannah and I, now that we have a work data mixed panel, we can get pretty darn close to all this. Yeah, well, this has. That makes sense. It's like. Nurturing has like a bajillion live offers. They all have targeting on them such that, like, one might get one visitor in a month. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That doesn't count to me as. Yeah, that's fair. I put. Well, this was a question I have for you. We have sessions impacted in mixed panel. Like, we had them send that all over. Interesting. Experience? No. So it's like per org, which is what your definition of an active org is, Right? Experience level. So this is like, how many have impacted checkup? How many people are there on the track? Okay, okay. Yeah. And you said it's 2%. So that's your percent. Okay, so five. That's. And then if you go to offer. Is it 5? Two percent is like. 40 or 50 brands. Yeah. That's about. Right. Sherry, what's the other question? Does offers show you 5%? Though. I know. Actually, it's going to be higher because. Again. This is like. Anyway. Yeah. Oh, perks. Yours is like, has ever been active and are they impacting 10% sessions of their total? Yeah, but, but, but my guess is that it's all like. Like someone turns it off and has nothing active. They would still be counted towards that because they had it on, like. Three weeks ago. Yeah, right. Yeah. And so, like, this is, like, people turning out on and off. Yeah, we should think about how. Kind of what we use mixed panel for and what we. Yeah. Don't I think. I think we can also lean more on Jerry or Michael or, like, Donald to help. Build more of this if we want to. Like the scent. They were like, hey, help your. Relative to measure. But yeah. Like. So 5%. Right now for component. I. Don't buy that, but that's fine. Whether it's 2%, 3%. It's 2%. Checkout blocks that says it doesn't include otherwise. My guess is that 2%. Because even offers don't have a component. And then necessarily, they don't have to. No. So that 5% is probably offers. It must have been. Oh, but again, it was looking at if the entire org has 10% sessions affected. Is what? My and has an offer. An offer with a component. An offer with a component? Yeah. So it's like offer with a component. Even if that offer is going to one person. Right. So that's the difference between what you're tracking. Yeah. Sorry. My life. Also. Morning. The dairy block. Okay, I'll be back. Here. My computer here. Sounds good. All right. Yeah. See you, david. That might be nice, because then we can walk through it. On the agency. Yeah, that. Sounds perfect. Sounds. Good things. Talk to you later. No. Oh, yeah. See the bench. Have fun. See ya.
