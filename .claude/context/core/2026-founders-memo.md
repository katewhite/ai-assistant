## Review of 2025

Intelligems had an incredible 2025. We doubled our revenue to ~$10.2M ARR. We worked with more than 4,000 brands to launch more than 40,000 tests and experiences. We more than doubled our team, adding ~30 new folks, and onboarded them successfully. We did a *lot* right in 2025. We want to start this memo off by saying ***THANK YOU!!!*** 

This achievement took a tremendous amount of work from every one of you. We are so grateful. It is a real privilege to build this team and see you come together to create and work together. It’s incredible to see the care and love that you give to our customers; the pride you take in your respective crafts; and the dedication to help make our vision a reality. You also all make Intelligems fun, and thank you for brining your whole selves here. 

Our mission and vision are clear for the road ahead:

- Our Mission is to **Make Commerce Intelligent**
- Our Vision is **a world where every business continuously learns from each purchase and adapts to every customer—creating more value for buyers and sellers**

## Looking Ahead

Going into 2026, it’s time to **increase our ambition and push our performance.** 

Our context today is a different than last year:

- There is now zero doubt that our + our customers industry is about to be completely shifted by AI. We’re in a position to be on the leading edge and turn this into a tremendous advantage. We’re right “around the net” thanks to our last 5 years of work, and we have a chance to slam home a goal as the opportunity arises
- We’re surrounded by more competitors than ever before, a testament to the opportunity ahead of us. And we’re continuing to accelerate faster than the competition, a nod to the quality of our product and team. This competition will inevitably commoditize parts of our offering - this is a gift for us to focus even more on ways we can produce outsized value for customers
- Our 60-strong team is ramped and operating effectively and with context. We have a clear mission and vision to go after

It is time to think and go BIG, and quickly. There is a window of opportunity here, and there is going to be a huge amount of capital available to those on the leading edge — we must move fast to capture it.  The goal is to win, not to keep business as usual. This year will feel different. 

From an outcomes perspective: **we aim to triple Intelligems’ revenue this year**, and close the year > $30M in ARR. This is audacious and also achievable. We get there when we:

- Increase our customer count by 160% from 2,300 to 6,000. This is achievable by adding customers at the same rate as 2025, accelerating partner growth, and improving gross retention to hold on to more of our customers.
- Grow our Average Contract Value (ACV) by 40%, from $360/mo to $500/mo, possible through adding more value for customers, improving our pricing, and adding more service-like offerings

We mentioned this earlier but it bears repeating: **time is the enemy and our success depends on our ability to focus and execute quickly**.  We’re investing in the team and in growth because we are *incredibly* optimistic about this future and our ability to win in it. We need to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and we need to embrace action. There’s a great quote from George Patton that feels relevant: "A good plan vigorously executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week."$^1$

There is real urgency to this plan. We’re making major investments, which will ramp up our burn. We are doing this because we believe we can have a great fundraise when we achieve this plan. That said, we’ll be closely monitoring the return and value of our investments — doubling down when things are working well and scaling back when they’re not. Our goal is to define what success looks like, iterate quickly, and win. We can do that this year.

## OKRs

In order to achieve these goals, we need to make sure that we (a) are all on the same page what the most important goals are and (b) are collectively working on the highest leverage projects to achieve those goals. To this end, we’ll be using OKRs (there’s a great blog post introducing the concept [here](https://www.perdoo.com/resources/online-guides/okr-guide#okr-as-a-goal-management-framework)) across the company in 2026 and be consistent about tracking. 

Here are our company-level Objectives for 2026$^2$:

1. Deliver outsized **value** that requires minimal effort from customers, much of which is delivered “while they sleep”
2. Build the Intelligent Commerce **Platform & Ecosystem**
3. **Scale revenue** efficiently, predictably, and aggressively
4. Hire **great people** and build systems that scale

Let’s talk about each

### **Objective 1: Deliver outsized value that requires minimal effort from customers, much of which is delivered “while they sleep”**

*Why is this an objective?*

Nothing is more important than delivering value to customers over the long term of our business. This is the reason they pay us and spend time working with us. Customers should feel like they get an *overwhelming* amount of value — the best products are obviously great. 

There’s another part to this equation though - effort. If I get 100 units of value, but had to spend 90 units of effort, that’s a lot less appealing than something that gives me 50 units of value with 1 unit of effort. We need to think about the “value:effort ratio”; let’s maximize value and reduce the effort involved. This can create a huge compounding effect by increasing how much customers will pay *and* reducing churn. 

We’re introducing a new term that we’ll be using a lot: **“while you sleep” value**. Without lifting a finger after initial setup, Intelligems is creating value in the background. Creating more “while you sleep” value will make us incredibly sticky and is a great way to drive the value-effort ratio towards infinity. 

Executing effectively against this objective will solve for a *lot* of good key results: improved retention, higher contract sizes, more referrals, and more scalable systems. 

*What mindsets and behaviors will we need to shift to execute well here?*

- We need to be comfortable putting ourselves out there and having a perspective about *how* customers should use Intelligems. We’re not just training them, we are telling them what to do and how to make more money
- We need to be accountable to our customers’ results and making them more money. Success isn’t just them using the tool - it’s them making more money
- To support the above, we need to be willing to be wrong - not all of our ideas and suggestions will work; but by trying we will learn
- Every new product feature we build needs to increase customer value; the vast majority should support “while you sleep” value
- We continue to tell a story about how Intelligent Commerce is more than just testing

*Why should we be optimistic?*

- Customers who are *not* using Intelligems at all are 50% more likely to churn than those that are active.
- Customers who are *not* using an always-on experience are 2x more likely to churn than those who are using at least one. So always-on experiences are meaningfully better than our regular product usage.
- During November, our worst churn month in 2 years, likely due to usage patterns over BFCM which showed a huge dip in usage.

- However, there was *no dip* in usage of always-on features, it continued to steadily grow straight through BFCM!

### **Objective 2:** Build the Intelligent Commerce **Platform & Ecosystem**

*Why is this an objective?*

Intelligems is part of an ecosystem of agencies, brands, and tech partners (especially Shopify) that’s bound together through content, best practices, influencers, events etc. This ecosystem has driven our growth to date. We’ve seen our partners do marketing for us, whether it’s posting blue bars on social media or creating how-to videos on youtube. And for the most part, we don’t pay for this marketing, it’s *free!* 

We want to lean more into this strength - when we establishing ourselves as a tech platform and arbiters of “Intelligent Commerce”, we will build our own ecosystem that creates value for our customers and a moat for ourselves. 

Being a tech *platform* means that others can build new capabilities on top of Intelligems through APIs, AI tools, automations, and maybe apps someday - just like how Shopify uses its partner network to create value for customers. This allows us to accelerate our product faster than our own capacity, and create lock-in. It’s also a great way to create value for our customers (the first objective) beyond our own roadmap. Everybody wins.

*What mindsets and behaviors will we need to shift to execute well here?*

- Agencies are a CUSTOMER for us. We should treat them accordingly
- When building, we should think API first - how can this feature be externalized to be able to be used by hackers and partners?

*Why should we be optimistic?*

- Our agencies, who have adopted the most of our tools already, have > 105% net retention!
- Customers that use a partner are significantly stickier (3-5% improvement in net retention) than those that do not use a partner

### **Objective 3: Scale revenue** efficiently, predictably, and aggressively

*Why is this an objective?*

We believe we can accelerate our growth trajectory. We’ve been incredibly efficient in our growth to date, and are willing to be a little bit *less* efficient in order to grow faster - especially when we believe we are sending customers into a more highly-retaining machine. 

Showing that we can consistently turn $1 of investment in growth into > $1 of profit - while we scale up - is a huge unlock. That machine is what will take us to $100M ARR and beyond, and it’s what investors are ultimately buying into. 

We’ll achieve this by making sure our efforts are as effective as possible and doubling down quickly on promising growth avenues. When things work, we want to lean into those strengths with urgency.

We have a number of growth channels: sales-led, partner-led, and self-service. Each of these are contributing meaningfully to our growth, and that diversity is a tremendous strength and opportunity. It’s also a challenge, because the needs of each channel are slightly different, not to mention the needs of each of our customer types. It means we need our product needs to serve a variety of needs and the touch points with our team can be complex and vary widely. If we can continue to grow each of these channels efficiently, we’re well on the path towards the next tier.

*What mindsets and behaviors will we need to shift to execute well here?*

- A bias towards vigorous execution of new growth experiments and faster scaling
- Every single person at the company feels accountable to customer retention in order to maximize our growth investments

*Why should we be optimistic?*

Because we are starting with *so much room* for improvement. In 2025 we added $13M in new potential ARR through reactivations and new customers. $13M!! We also had $8M of potential ARR churn out. 

This means that our growth engine is absolutely ripping - $13M in adds in a year with a team of our size is insane. 

If we can cut down on the $8M a bit we have an incredible amount of upside

### **Objective 4:** Hire **great people** and build systems that scale

*Why is this an objective?*

People are the most important asset we have, and we need to always be raising the bar. As the saying goes, *Iron sharpens iron*, we must hold each other accountable while also supporting each others’ growth. As we grow the team, we must continue to keep extremely high expectations and standards. The systems in which we work together must continue to be improved and refined as the company scales; any friction will create a lot of drag. 

*What mindsets and behaviors will we need to shift to execute well here?*

- We hold each other accountable to the highest bar, and remember that kindness = honesty when it comes to feedback
- On cross-functional work, we take joint ownership instead of passing balls back and forth
- We are an OKR-driven company that reports on outcomes regularly

*Why should we be optimistic?*

While we don’t have numerical data points here, we can all look around the room at the caliber of people and have great faith we can keep this up. 

## The most important key result

While we aren’t discussing all of the key results in this memo, there is one we want to highlight and exceptionally high leverage: 90% gross retention in the first 90 days. This means that if we add $1M of new customers in January, by the end of April we should still have at least $900k of it. Anything less means our sales, marketing, and onboarding efforts are being wasted and we need to work extra hard to grow. 

But this is certainly achievable through a number of initiatives that start in sales and marketing and continue through our human-led and product-led onboarding. If we can create “while-you-sleep” value early on for customers, we can certainly achieve this. 

Expect spend a lot of time talking, thinking, and working towards this goal of 90% 90-day retention this year! 

### How we’ll achieve this

At a high level, we can do this by creating a tremendous amount of value for our customers, clearly showing them the value we’re creating, and ensure we’re delivering it continuously “while they sleep” with low effort. The old “tell them what you’re going to do, do it, tell them you did it” maxim. 

An old concept with a new framing is “while-you-sleep” value — if we focus on this across teams we give ourselves a great shot to deliver outsized value.

Today, our customers are literally only getting the “tip of the iceberg” from Intelligems and they’re putting in a lot of effort to get it. 

- “I didn’t know it was possible” — let’s educate them how
- “My team doesn’t have a developer” — let’s provide the no-code solutions
- “I don’t have the time” — they can pay us to do it for them
- “It’s overwhelming, there’s so much to do” — let’s help them prioritize and make a plan
- “It doesn’t work with [____]” — let’s build some capabilities in-house and others on top of us

Every single one of our teams should be working on ways to improve this. Expect us to be taking on projects such as:

- A personalized roadmap to kick off the sales process
- Guided recommendations when you install the app
- Doing it for our customers when they don’t have the bandwidth
- Improving the rough edges of the product to make it easy and delightful
- Using AI to generate ideas on how to maximize the value from Intelligems
- Making our native features (”profit levers”) meet the needs of our customers
- Building more features (e.g., checkout upsells) that can turn always-on

## A final note

Everything we need to do to succeed is right in front of us. There are no secrets or mysteries about what we need to do. We need to improve retention, create value with less effort, and continue our growth. That’s not to say these things are not hard - making changes at an organization of our size are never easy - but it’s a massive advantage to *know* what we need to do. 

We are an organization full of kind, empathetic, and helpful people. I also know that we are a team of achievers. We love to win, hate to lose, and want to be truly exceptional at what we do. We know that this takes hard work, practice, and resilience along the way and we always learn from our losses. 

2026 is the playoffs and we know exactly what we need to do to win. Let’s go get it.
