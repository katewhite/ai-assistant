Drew has been having feedback calls with ecommerce companies who are not Intelligems customers. His main goal is to get genuine feedback and learn about what problems these companies still face today, but also get the Intelligems name out there and sell a little bit. Here are the Slack messages he’s posted about the calls, and the transcripts from all of them.

1. [**Impact analytics**](https://www.impactanalytics.co/)
    1. raised series D in may
    2. "end to end merchandising for retail" - seems very enterprise targeted
    3. "AI pricing tool" is part of pitch - seems ilke a lot of automation; can't find much online
    4. going to try to network with their chief strategy officer who was also at mckinsey around my time

2. [Noibu](https://www.noibu.com/)

- was this a competitor to fullstory [@Milan Patel](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/team/U08D84Q7YH2)?
- seems like the pitch is "plug us in and we'll find where issues are blocking conversions, and therefore get you more conversions"
- session tracking, replays, heatmaps, speed analysis - find gaps in the funnel
- also pretty enterprise-y list

[3. Session AI](https://www.noibu.com/)

- "behavioral AI" that detects a customers' likelihood to purchase and takes actions accordingly
- one use case is targeted offers - instead of sitewide - similar to our dynamic offers thinking (cc [@Michael Shames](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/team/U0840P5UA0K) [@Andrew Raftery](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/team/U03GCCR924A))
- Also enterprise-y 

4. [Metrical](https://metric.al/)

- "Use AI to identify and engage shoppers before they leave, and predicts who will abandon their purchase, and present targeted offers, reulsting in higher conversion rates and increased revenue"
- enterprise-y case list (JC Penny, Pier 1, container store)

5. [Frenzy AI](https://www.frenzy.ai/product)

- Shopify merchandising tool - "generate 38% more revenue through (a) search (b) recommendations (c) collection pages"
- Customer we spoke to "they gave me 30 days to AB test it vs. rebuy - was an easy sell since it was money back guarantee - and i saw better revenue per session so i kept it"

6. [Profit Peak](https://www.profitpeak.io/) (this one actually came from stage 2)

- smaller, shopify focused
- all about profit analytics
- maybe interesting stuff for partnering at some point? (cc [@Jerry Wu](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/team/U078913EVP0))

[**Spresso.ai**](http://spresso.ai/) has come up on a few of these feedback calls. So just did a bit of a rabbit hole:

- The pitch: we automatically find the right prices for your products and are always monitoring to find the price that maximizes profit
- They've been around for a while, but my sense (btw these calls and linkedin) is that they recently hired a bunch of sales folks and are doing a decent job canvassing the market / getting the name out
    - No clear case studies or users i've come across yet
    - Most of the team came from Boxed, ~35 ppl
- What's resonating with customers:
    - **AI -** "my boss will forward me any email that says they can automate something with AI"
    - **Always on optimization / low manual effort -** "it's cool that it always is just kind of checking for us and we don't need to set anything up - that makes a lot of sense to me"
    - **Pricing is a hard problem -** we know this 🙂
- Interesting notes:
    - they're now tracked in storeleads (i posted the install list in [#team-sales](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/archives/C05J15WE61M))
    - They use VERY similar integration methods for us with shopify ([here](https://spresso.readme.io/docs/shopify-plus-install-instructions)) with price selectors, adding a cart attribute, etc.
    - You add cogs, like us, but they [also allow you to input any MAP prices per product](https://spresso.readme.io/docs/catalog-intake-copy)
    - They support other platforms (also in the docs) - maybe useful if we ever go broader
    - You set up an "[Agent](https://spresso.readme.io/docs/agent-configurations)" for each "product family"
        - [@Jerry Wu](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/team/U078913EVP0) check it out - similar idea to what we've been talking about, they use tags; they require manual assignment
        - The "Agent" is basically the optimization parameters:
            - MAP price, whether to use compare at price
            - Rev vs. profit maximzation
            - Price rounding rules
            - Min price / max price
