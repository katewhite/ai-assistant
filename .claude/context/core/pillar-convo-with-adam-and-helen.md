Meeting Title: Experiences Pillar Strategy with Adam and Helen
Date: Dec 9, 2025

Transcript:
 
Them: It's good. It's funny. Drew and I. I don't know how they ended up back to back. We spend such a very, very, very small percentage of our time talking to potential investors. Right now because we're not fundraising but to, like intro calls with VCs back to back.  
Me: Interesting.  
Them: We did zero prep. Totally cold. And it was fine. It was great. We were pros. They asked the same questions that they were asked in the A and that they asked in the seed, and it's like, no questions we haven't gotten before. And then the other fun part was. Talking about sort of the strategy and, like, the direction is. Is always going to be a facet of it. So I got to practice talking about, like, sort of the product strategy and the components there and then, and I think it went fine. I, like, totally winged it. Off top of my head, but it was good. And then I asked Granola Feedback and was like, you did a really good job, like, Honestly, just remove some filler words and you can, like, hear, like, some sentences that you can use up front to tighten it up and, like, lead with a really strong, concise, you know. Thought, but also give me a lot of positive feedback. So I appreciate Granola.  
Me: That's awesome. Yeah.  
Them: Cool. All right. I. I mean, I can maybe. I could elaborate on maybe some of my thoughts if they. If more color would be helpful or if you feel like you get what I was coming from.  
Me: Yeah, I'm happy to just dive in with my thoughts. On those two. I'm kind of calling them initiatives, pillars, whatever we want to call them. I think. Yeah. I'm thrilled by the idea that these might come together. Better. Which is why I'm kind of saying, like, I think what you're outlining is, like, initiatives and focus for the year, which is super, super exciting. And where those land, like, within product area ownership doesn't feel exactly direct. And I think that's good. I think that's a very good thing. So that's why I'm kind of like pillars versus initiatives. Makes more sense to me. But for what it's worth, like, again, those are just words, I think.  
Them: Word ladder. I'm increasingly learning that.  
Me: Yeah, I mean, I. I obviously believe that, but that's how distinction between like a pillar, at least as the way we've used them before. And then like what you're kind of outlining here.  
Them: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's really helpful. I'm also thinking about it maybe, like. Similar but different, which is like, I'm thinking about these pillars for, like, a quarter. So it's basically like an initiative. Or two. Like, there's, like, one or two big rocks.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That we could possibly do in the next quarter. And each pillar and so, like. That is also sort of my thinking about, like, the mapping of Pillar two initiative is because I'm kind of thinking about it. Not for the whole year, necessarily, but more on a short term, because, like, I don't know. And maybe that's, that's too short sighted, but I, I, I'm, my brain right now is thinking about sort of like. A quarter out. Do you feel year long to me, honestly, like, these all feel pretty fundamental to like the, what the product is going to be. I think the, the initiatives within the pillars are probably going to change quarter by quarter. Like we're going to spend, you know, a quarter on, I don't know, adding new offer types or something, let's say. And then in the next quarter we might move on to something else for profit, lovers. But I think, like, the. The core pillars should be something we could keep for the whole year if possible. Y.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So.  
Me: I agree. Would a pillar be like a strategic pillar, not like a product area ownership? Like, it's not, like, a product area, right? We're not trying to, like. Put a high level on, like the taxonomy of the product.  
Them: I know it's a little messy. It's not. I don't know if. Yeah. But you're right, you're right. The. The pillars probably are like, do you have longevity to them? And my thinking is still about, like, at least as I've been thinking about, like, how do I map people and, like, initiatives to it. Yeah, it's been a shorter term thing. I guess, like. There's this, like. Overarching thing, the encompassing thing in this experiences pillar. I'm I re branded campaigns to experiences. And. We can revisit that. But, like. I think there is this, like, Really ambitious, heady thing that we're trying to do, which is, like, go beyond testing, right? It's like, we want to power. All of this different surface area of your site, we want to make it Intelligems Testing is a part of that, but like personalization and being dynamic. And making it easy to set up and create and turn on and off and schedule and like. And also, like, more responsive and adaptive. That that's all like and, and changing the paradigm of, like, how people use our product. Conceptually, like what is the mental model? Is like. That is, like, the big overarching thing here. I also like. The first bullet point of. Key results in your thing, which was like 75% of people are using stuff that is not just testing. Right? Like they have 75% of people are using multiple things, many of like of which are always on. What was the exact bullet that you let me like, pull up your notion, doc.  
Me: Multi product. And I was still, like, using the definitions that we have in place today.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Just like shipping, pricing, content, those are all different products within intelligence. So whether it's a test.  
Them: Yeah. 75% cross product adoption.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And I think that's the right North Star. For it. And so that's why, like, Anyway. It's because then, like. As. As I think about them, like, how do we execute against that? It's like. How do we shift people's mental model away from. I want to run a landing page test. To. There are all of these things that are best practice in. I need to, like, do handfuls of these different things. We need to, like, make sure that those things are. All really easy to do, and they fit into this mental model. Like, to me, that stuff is like the. There's a lot of ambiguity. There. And. And a big part of that is, like, what are the different surface areas and levers? That we can fit into that mental model. And how do we fit those all together? And that's like, kind of my thinking of, like. I don't know, Kate, where I feel like that was like, in my. When I, like, put my thoughts to paper. Where I was thinking you would fit is like this, like, sort of. Leveling up of this thing and, like. Again, a very initiative oriented thought. But, like, why I liked Hannah on this, like revamp the experience creation flow is because this is like a very well defined problem. Like, people do this every day. Hannah has done this thousands of times. Like, that is not sort of like it is not zero to one. We're not trying. To introduce new stuff. We're not trying to change the way people think about things. We're trying to make something that exists into something that exists way better. And so anyway, that was, like, my framing of it all. And so. And I think that, like, what Hannah uniquely brings to the table is the, like. Breadth and depth of experience. And, like, she has set up whatever thing that she has set up the least number of times, she has probably done that more times than most people have done most things. So, like, and, and that's why, again, Like, thinking of framing it from the point of. The point of view of, like, this thing already exists, and we're trying to make it much better anyway, so.  
Me: I. I agree with most of what you're saying. It might be just where I'm envisioning the lines between the two. So, like, it seemed like you're almost narrowing the scope of, like, the one initiative, which is test setup, to literally, like, the setup flow. And in my mind, I was thinking, like, how do people think about an experience versus a test? How do they roll it out? How do they build it? What's the previewer? Look like. How do they know that? Everything they're doing is, like, definitely gonna look like what? It looks like what we're showing them.  
Them: Okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Me: Like, how do they build, like, an end to end? I've been using, like, the buyer end to end experience a lot as, like, you shouldn't be, like, coming to us and saying, I want. To put an offer on this page. You should be saying like, it's Black Friday, Cyber Monday. I need all these components on my page. I needed to start here and end here. I need it to go to these people for this reason, like it's a whole thing.  
Them: It's journey design. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. Whereas the profit lovers I'm seeing as like, we can't do so much there until we have all of the gaps filled. What people can do.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And that felt a little more like, constrained. Yeah.  
Them: 100 agree with you, because I do think, like, you're talking about something that's, like, really horizontal, that we've been treating as a. Like a slice, like a vertical slice and like that. When you say you. When you say you, are you saying Kate or me? No, I think, like, us in general, I think we've been talking about, like, oh, test setup is like, this vertical slice. But I think what Kate's trying to do is, like, open the aperture and be like. Actually, it's all these things that, like, make up the connective tissue of the product. Right. And. I actually agree with that. And I can see. The Private lover execution piece. Like, if somebody holds sort of the strategy for the profit lovers, the execution piece is somebody is something that, like, I think Hannah could be really successful at. Like, if we said, Hannah, go build us an amazing bundle builder, I feel like she would be great at going and taking that and scoping that. Which she's not great at, is thinking about, like, contextually, strategically. How does this thing fit into all these other things, right? And it's not because, you know, it's just she's not experienced. Like, she doesn't have a ton of UX experience or product experience. Right. It's nothing wrong with Hannah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was thinking about it as, like, if we put these things closer together, like, Kate is ready. To step up and do more. And I think we need to support that type of sort of horizontal thinging. So she's thinking across most of, like, these bigger things. Hannah can absolutely step in and execute, like, slices of these things, right? Yeah. Yeah, because Hannah struggles with, like, ambiguity and, like, when to cut things and, like, And Angela also struggles with ambiguity. Like, Hannah and Angela are actually, like, a deadly combination. So. That. Works for me. Like the risk I'm trying to mitigate is like. Not. Not even mitigate. I. I see, like, part of. And I'm. I. I am seeing it very much in this, like, narrow, vertical slice. To. I think what you're saying. And there's. There are components to that narrow vertical slice that are, like, important that we, like, need to visit or, like, need to work. Well, like, how do we. Like, how do people set up a price test in this new paradigm? How do people set up a shipping test? Like, one of the pieces. When I was in LA and I was with the success team, like, the top of, like, I was surprised by the top of their wish list. On the product side was an improved shipping test flow. And like. Like I just don't. That. First of all, that was a surprise to me. I was like, that wasn't even on my bingo card. And which they were like. They were like, how was that possible? They were like, this is the biggest, like, most painful thing that we deal with. Everyone wants to run a shipping test. It's, like, the easiest thing to, like, upsell them onto. Plus, if they don't want to run a price test, there's always opportunities to run shipping tests, and it's the worst. And I like. Like the UX for running the shipping test. I don't know how recently you guys have, like, done this. It's like. It's like literally, Carolyn designed it in Figma.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like. When Carolyn was, like, doubling as our, like, product designer. So. So, anyway, so I guess what I'm trying to say is, like. And maybe, like, we need to attack some of this stuff. At two, like, at two levels of altitude where there's, like, some really, like, maybe Kate, you and Hannah both are, like, tactically are working on some of this, like, core experience stuff where, like, the part that Hannah is working on is, like, how do we make sure shipping tests fit well into this and we can get improvements. To like someone who wants to run a free shipping threshold test. At the same time, we are also, like, changing the the journey that people go through when they want to use intelligence. To, like, allow more profit levers to slot into it. Is that like. I don't know. Am I? Is that idea? Hearing you guys.  
Me: I think, like. And I definitely need to be checked on this. I might be thinking too big, almost, But I feel like if we have better systems in place, Holistically across, like building an experience and a test. So reusable components, a visual previewer, tagging locations that applies even to a shipping test. Like, where are all the places you need to change the terminology around your shipping test? I envision that, then. And how much of it we tackle in parallel. And the sequencing I'm not as certain about. Like, maybe we can make some small improvements even as we make these bigger ones. But then. Idealistically. The. The improvements, then, to shipping tests like fit into this more reusable, more understandable, intuitive system that we now have in place for all the types of levers. While at the same time, Hannah is. And we are introducing more breadth. Across the lever coverage. So, like, right now, you know, like, she, she. We can still go bxgy and we can still do more with gwps and we can do all that stuff. We're gonna fit it into what exists today in the ui. And it still might not be very intuitive, and it still might not be, but, like.  
Them: Are you suggesting? Are you suggesting pausing the work on the like, embedded editing and preview for now until, like.  
Me: Not necessarily, but it depends on what you mean by the work that's happened. I don't. I guess I maybe don't know what's happening. I know she's doing some exploration, maybe, and, like, getting feedback from customers. Seemed like it was an exploratory stages. Definitely not. We, like quit exploring that. I think the explorations and. And that part, that initiative definitely needs to happen now. I would like to get even more concrete about it. I'm not convinced that, like, taking tabs and putting them on one page is the highest value thing we could be doing right now for, like, experience creation.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Stuff like that. Like, I think, like, improvements to experience creation. Certainly, like, we can explore.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But should we just, like, reconfigure the ui? I'm not convinced. That's enough. I think.  
Them: Yeah. And like, where do all the. Because components live and things like that? Like that. That feels like in order of operations thing where it's like you want to solve sort of the architecture piece.  
Me: I do hear that the preview is going to keep getting pushed off because it's big.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But, like. Yeah, in my mind. And I've worked with this a little bit, just kind of in Pig Jam, moving things around. It's like components. Because we're going to solve the. Because use case. Maybe locations. Although I think we can brute force some of that to start with. And. And then kind of like the preview. Maybe the first. Entry into the preview is just saving your locations and then you're doing more with actual preview. And then we're bringing other profit lovers in to leverage it to. I don't know. I haven't dug too deep into that, but I do think. There's some. Smaller, quicker things we can do. Ahead of it.  
Them: Yeah. I buy all this, it's like it's flipping a little bit. Like, in the order of operations in my mind is changing a little bit.  
Me: Your order of operations was more like.  
Them: Yeah, in my mind. Like in my mind, the win. And again, I am not. Like, I want to qualify. Like, I am not a product whiz. Like, I don't understand journeys and stuff. Like, that's what, like, you guys are for. And I, like, want to, like, trust you. A lot. One of the things that I am excited about, was really excited about, is like this coupling of two things. One is the ability to build components and place them in the site. And number two is the ability to transition away from what we call our like on site editor and preview. Because that is just like an atrociously bad user experience into something that allows us to do it all in the context of our app, where you can, like, make the changes and preview it all right there. And I feel like that both. I feel like. What? Angela and emily. Like what Angela and Emily presented. Largely, in part of their, like, creation flow, largely captured a lot of, like, what would, I think would be a lot of value. On both of those fronts. And it's not about, like, whether it's one page or three pages or tabs or scrolling or whatever. Like, for me, it was about. Killing the on site editor. And bringing that in. To the like bringing that into our app and then it makes it very easy to build components in place them. So, like your point about placements. Like, was like, the one counter intuitive thing I felt like from. Because that was, like, really kind of silly. And so. And that this really easily well, solves that. And so I was excited about those things. I feel like those would add a lot of value. I think Emily's sense is that those would add a lot of value as well. And so what I worry, like, what I'm sort of thinking that I'm hearing you say is actually, we're, like, pushing network out, starting with. I don't know. And maybe I don't understand the. The order of operations, but, like, it's like, oh, like, maybe let's go tackle bx. Get y now. And while we do some of this exploration stuff and figure that out,  
Me: No, I don't think I was saying, like, push it out past even Q1. Just more of, like, where it lands. In the realm of those two initiatives, I think profit level, like, if we want to, we could also decide that, like, Increasing profit lever. Breadth. Is less of a priority. Than previewing. Setting up tests. Making it intuitive. And we could front load all of that work and have Hannah and I both tackle that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I was seeing Profit Lover as another initiative, which means, like, kind of now. And keep working on checkout, keep working on bxgy, keep working on all those things. So I was thinking parallelized those two things. Which means, like, maybe components comes before the visual editor, but the visual editor could totally come immediately after components, which is what I was suggesting. Like, once you have components and you have somewhere to place them, You can pick locations using the onsite editor right now. It's not ideal. But then we cover the because use case those customers are happy. We're starting to introduce reusable components. The way you place them, still crappy. But then, like, immediately after, we start working on, like, okay, how do we make this? Easier to place. With a visual preview.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And I think what we're not convinced on is, like, will the on site. Preview be embedded preview actually be superior. Like, can it handle every use case? Or are we going to end up in a case where it's like I preview some things but not others and some things don't show up unless you turn around and stand on your head three times or whatever, and they're going, to have to jump into the full screen experience, like for certain use cases anyway, because then that's not a great experience. It's like, when can you do some things over here versus over here? And then there's also like the QA experience. Like, if you want to have somebody else like qa, this test with you. You know, can you send them a URL and have that work and, you know, that kind of thing. Right. So I don't like. I think that needs to get, like, more technical exploration to be like, well, what could we successfully handle? In an embedded mode versus when would we need to fall over to that. That full screen mode? So, like, I would love to keep pushing on that and get some technical investigation done, which I think, like, Hannah had some questions for Christian already, from what I understand. Yeah. Because, like, it needs to be dramatically better, like, to make the investment worth it. Yeah, yeah. No, it does.  
Me: I guess I also don't know how far down that path. Hannah has gotten. So again. Take that. Even with a grain of salt, like, is it all okay?  
Them: Not. That far. No, no, I don't think she's gone that far. Yeah. I mean. I. I feel like I'm. I'm. I'm trying to. I'm. I'm so busy synthesizing, maybe, like. One of use. What? What? What? Like if I were to go back to this notion, Doc. Or. I don't know. Maybe. I guess what I'm asking for is, like. Could we what is your what do you like? Given the conversation, my input, does that change any of your thinking? Or do you still think what's in the notion doc is right? And maybe I'm just curious to get your current thinking of like what. What you think the plan should be.  
Me: I mean.  
Them: And that's code view, by the way. Sorry, I'm not to put you on the spot, Kate. And like Helen, you and I also have, like, more context below this. Too. I can. I can speak to it, which is I. I did feel like the way Kate outlined it in the document really resonated. I think the campaign's name was problematic, and, like, that throws me off a little bit. But if we thought of it as, like, we have a pillar around experiences, and then there's, like, different things that support experiences, and, like, all of our experiences are testable. Like, to her point about, like, we should be able to easily test anything that we're allowing people to do right, then I think that that is cohesive as like high level, strategic, like vision pillar, right? And then I think that there needs to be some connective tissue between what Hannah's doing and what Kate's doing. Like the profit lovers piece versus like, sort of this, like, broader experiences, vision, right? And I do want to nest Anna under Kate, like, just for overall, like, development reasons. Like, I think it's the right choice to. To make. Right? I don't 100%. I'm like, 100. I did talk to Hannah about that today, by the way, just to flag to both of you. And she was kind of, like, blank about it. She was like, oh, okay. You know, it wasn't overjoyed, and it wasn't like, oh, no. You know. So I said, like, okay, well, you know what we want. Is to give you, like, figure out, like, what's the right strategic mission for you. Right? And then that way you'll have somebody to sort of sync up with, and you guys can do your planning together. And it won't feel like you're doing these kind of more like, isolated, like, we want off. This one off that. And she did like that. And I did flow to her like, what do you think about sort of like this private lovers concept? And she was like, oh, I know exactly what I would do with that. I wouldn't do Carter. I would do a bundle builder, you know, so it's like, oh. Okay, here's a place where, like, that actually resonated. She perks right up. It felt contained, you know, and. But what she doesn't have is necessarily, like, the whole strategy, right? Yeah. Somebody else was holding, like, the strategy. I do think she would go off and, like, execute on these, like, very contained problems. In, like, a very successful way. Okay? All. Right.  
Me: Adam, it sounds like your concern actually was more around. Like the more detailed, like, sequencing of the exact projects and work that we do as a result of this.  
Them: Yeah. I'm trying to like. I'm trying to like. I'm asking myself in real time, why am I, like, what is my worry? Or what am I trying to solve for? And I'm, like, figuring it out. Like, internally, I. Like something doesn't totally feel right. But, like. My like, I think. For me, the clunkiest part of our app is like our experience, creation, flow. Where it's like you get this, like. Terrible prompt that doesn't let you go past it. To you add your name until you add the experiment name. And then like. Then the next thing we ask you to do is to, like, what type of test is it based on? Like, the technology being used and not based on the use case. And then like, that, by the way, is like, bifurcated already based on whether it's like an experience, as we call it, or a test. And then, like, you go through this flow, which is, like, super different based on, like, the technology choice that you've made and, like. You then end up? With really low success rate. And I have, like. I feel like that is a huge opportunity that I'm really excited about. I. Might be like a dog with a bone, but, like, have this, like. And Helen, you've, like, heard me talk about that, like, embedded editor preview thing for a long time and, like, have this, like, strong belief. And by the way, it's not just that I've seen visually and used visually and think that they like, have executed that really well. I think they have. But, like, I don't know, like, Kate, when you did your, like, you know that vibe coded thing that you did right before the in person week, like, that was awesome and, like. By the way, like, price testing integrations, which is the other, like, worst thing that we have. Would be so much easier if it was like that. So, like, I just think that I'm really bullish on our ability to do that and that it is a much better experience and that, like, I have a lot fewer concerns about the technical capabilities, and I think that it's, like, much more about design and product and flows and things like that. I got very excited by what I saw. When I, like, looked at Angela's again. I know that was, like, the design sprint side project thing that she did, but, like. And maybe I am a dog with a bone, but I feel very bullish on. On that. And so I think my anxiety is. That, I think. And I think it's similar to what you're saying, Kate, which is like the mental model and the flows and the journeys. But I feel like if we don't, like. I think this is a very tactical part of that, and I feel like if we don't invest in this, then. We are like. All the other stuff doesn't quite. Like, I feel like this is a stepping stone to so much of the other stuff that we want to do. And. And it feels really like. Clear, obvious to me. And I just I, I, I, I want it. I want. To make feel like we're making progress on that. And. And I think that hannah. Should be part of it. I don't think needs to lead it. And I think the Hannah intelligence thing, like, I buy that that's not the right solution. And, like, so if it's, you know, Kate and Hannah on it. Then that's fine. But I think that that's, like, to me, the thing that I feel most urgently we need to make progress on. And. Yeah. And so. And. And I think there's also, like, there's going to be so much devil in the details there. And I think that's where Hannah's strengths will come into play. Is that, like, when we get into the. Like when we start getting into the. Like. Okay, like, shipping tests. We want to do a shipping threshold test. We want to run a like price test or an offer test or whatever. Like, I do think that there is going to be a lot of devil in the details of like, oh well, like our rate carrier needs to be installed by this point in the flow in order for this preview to work. And like it would be very very hard to do that kind of stuff without Hannah or someone who just knows the ins and the outs of, like, some of these things, so. Anyway, that's like, I think. Where where I'm at. I don't know. And maybe you guys are a lot less bullish on this than I am, which is fair.  
Me: No, I definitely agree with that. I I probably misspoke when I said it would be shoved out by that. I mean, like maybe second in line to the because use case. But we can definitely prioritize that work. It feels like. An ownership. You're still believing that? The details and customer closeness and experience of Hannah's is almost more valuable there than it would be for the profit lovers like. Bxgy, I mean. To be fair.  
Them: I think both are good. Like, let's say, like, I think BX2Y is a good foil for this. Like I, I would love to go invest and bxy. I just like. Like, I don't know, two off the cuff thoughts. One is that, like, we could introduce BX Get Y like, if 30 customers picked it up. Like, that would be in line with, like, offer usage or, or even if, if a hundred customers picked it up. That would be, like, outrageous. I feel like, based on, like, the. How many people have used quantity buttons. And so whereas, like, Even shipping tests we which are like. Let's use them. Price tests, which are less used than by an order of magnitude and content tests. Are still more than that in a month. And so, like, that's where I think that. And I don't see how, like. I just. I think that I, I I think that Hannah would be too valuable on some of those kinds of flows. Okay. I could be wrong, that I could be over indexing on where I think Hannah's expertise is and, like, But even, like. Like, frankly, I just, like, I don't even think I have the, like, depth of understanding and input on a shipping test. As. As Hannah. The one challenge you see with Hannah just to be straight is, like, sometimes she knows the rules almost so well. That it stifles innovation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fair. We get that this is the way it is thing, and we get this from Carolyn, like, to some extent, but, like, Hannah, I think, is the very much on, like, well, this is how it works. And it's like, well, that puts us off of, like. Finding work arounds and finding something that might be like, a better experience. Right. And so that is one concern that I do have. Having seen her in action, like, there's a lot of justification for how things work today, and this is why this. And it's like she's got all the rules straight in. Her head and I think she from like, the rules. Yeah, yeah. And, like, some of those rules are breakable and some of those rules aren't. Right? Like, so we serve at the Pleasure Shopify. Like, I totally get that. Like, serious platform limitations. And some things are, like, actually, we could do it, but our engineers have always said it's hard, you know? Yeah, yeah. And it's like, okay, well, let's get over that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. And that's where. And. And I think that that is totally. Totally. I, like, I am, by the way, susceptible to that, too. And so. And that's fair.  
Me: Sorry, y'all, I have to get kids, but I was trying to transfer over to my phone because I'm enjoying the conversation and can totally listen in the car, but.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Let. Me try this. Way.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, so some things are already shipped. Like, the concept of, like, Hannah reporting to Kate, that's already out in the wild with Hannah. She's gonna roll with that. She's cool with it. So it's like, really? We're coming down to, like, well, what do we name this pillar, right? And how do we sort of divvy up the ownership? And I think it's okay if it goes out tomorrow without the perfect name, but my point is, like, I want Kate over both of those things, and Hannah will have, like, ownership responsibilities, but I don't think it's like owning entire one of those flows. No. No input or supervision, if that makes sense. I guess. Yeah. Okay, fine, 100%.  
Me: Do we want to call it? One. Pillar. Or. Do we want it to be sort of like. Two. On key. Tracks. Bicycle. Initiative. There's, like, initiative. There's work streams. I mean. If. They're truly like Strateg. Ic. This is where. We. Believe in. Product strateg. Y. I think. Initiatives. Makes sense.  
Them: Like I just met with the VP of Engineering at Postscript for lunch yesterday. All of Postscript is doing their doing a leadership team off site here in Denver. So I met him for lunch. And we talked a lot about engineering managers and, like, what that role looks like. And stuff like that. So anyway. He had good thoughts and I. We can share anyway. Kate is back. I think we. I think we solved the core, like the. The. What do we call these pillars for now, right? Y and the reporting relationship. So what I heard is the next step is, Adam, you're going to go gas Hannah up a little bit about this sort of mission concept for profit lovers. Yep. Yeah. And. And I'm going to also preview this with. With Carolyn. Yes. Yeah. And Hannah's point, Her number one question is looking at me like, when can I get out of billing? So just that is probably what she sees as a barrier to, like, really driving on one of these. Cool. Oh, one more question I had. So is engineering doing December end of the year reviews? Because Christian asked me for help with reviews, and I was like, that's a weird time to do them like this. People go out on break and they stew, like, so December is, like, the last time I would do, like, group reviews. Okay? Like, I. I don't know. Like, I don't know. Is that a done deal? Is that something Sarah is rolling out and, like, about. I, like, have been rolling it out. So basically, like, I'll raise my hand and say, this is all coming from me. Basically like I put together. I've been. I've been getting feedback from many different angles that people are looking for more clarity on. Like, what are levels and what is getting a promotion look like? And how do I compare to, like, there are just so many people on the team that, like, it's very easy to be like, how do I compare to this person? Am I making more money? Am I a higher level whatever? And like. I think we have a good set of, like, comp levels in place and, like, bands in place. But I actually think that, like, we. Everyone has the same title until we started arbitrarily giving out different titles, like, very recently to people. And like, and also, like, they don't have a sense of, like, what is their title and what is, like, good look like. And so I've been getting that input. And so. I put in, I've created a structure which is like, here are the six levels, here's what each level looks like. I basically, if you've ever seen Dropbox, has a published version. And so I, like, took Dropboxes and adapted it and, like, made it more Intelligems and used Claude to help me write because it was, like, a tremendous writing. So I put that together. And I was when, like, I was thinking that because we are in code freeze, and we don't have, like, deadlines and it's like, December, that this would be a good time to have those conversations. We can wait until January if you think that it's a bad idea. Most people are doing fantastic, so. Like. There's only, like, There's only one person who's getting, like, really not positive feedback. And that person has already gotten that. That feedback. And then there's someone who's getting middling feedback, and that person has also been getting that feedback already, too. So for most people, it's actually like, here are the. Like, here's your. Your growth path. Kind of stuff. I'm like, here are the things that you can do better. And like, what a promotion in 2026 would look like for you is really. Yeah. If it feels like it's a no surprise this kind of thing, then don't worry about it. I was just like, wait a minute, is this like a company wide thing and I missed it? I'm supposed to everyone because, like, I'm only doing Hannah's right now because it's her anniversary. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then Carolyn, Christian, we're both like, can I steal this pure feedback form? Because I really like this format. And I was like, oh, sure, whatever. And then Christian was like, can you help me? Like, I'm. Trying to write a review, and I don't know what to do. And I was like, I'm happy to look at it, but, like, did I miss a memo? Basically, no, no, no. It's. And, like. And I'm not even doing it for, like, other roles. It's just, like, strictly for engineers. Where in code. Freeze. I've been getting this question because there's not leveling and there are so many of them. Yeah. I mean, normally you see it in November and you see it in January because, like, my only logic is, like, even though it's code free, is, like, people are coming in to the end of the year running on fumes, and I don't know if, like, they're as prepared as they might be. Like, after a little bit of arrest in terms of Carolyn and Christian, because. Because they're. They haven't done it before. Like, they're probably gonna need, like, a little bit more handholding. You could give them a deadline to, like, prep it, and, like, maybe we help them with feedback on how to structure things. And then they deliver it in, you know, early January. But that's up to you all. I just want to make sure. Like, I wasn't, like, out of single word. All good? Yeah. And by the way, I'll share with you. You still see my screen, right? Yeah. So there's like, Junior. I'm learning software. I think this is great. And, like, this is a little easier to digest, which is basically like. And so, you know, I don't know, like, not to throw. Put anyone on. On blast. It's like, okay, Brandy. Basically, like, 80% of the team falls into this bucket, and it's like, okay. It's like, actually, you do some like large features and medium projects and like, you are really good about balancing trade offs or whatever where like, You know, I think you could. Where you're still at is weekly instead of like buy week, you know, whatever. So like I, I haven't done any of the individuals things here, but it's like, hey, Brandy, here's what like your success path to like a software engineer two looks like, okay? Now, I think this will be really helpful. But maybe, yeah, pull up with Carolyn Christian. See, like, do they want more time or more support potentially? Cool. But awesome. All right, I think we have a solve for tomorrow. Thank you all so much. This is really helpful. Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to you soon. Cool.  
Me: Yeah. I think.  
Them: Bye.
