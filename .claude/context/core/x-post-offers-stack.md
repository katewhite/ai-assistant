This was a random CRO person on Twitter, posting about offers strategies. There are some great use-cases and the why behind each for Intelligems to keep in mind.

How to build an offer stack that prints $10M+
If you’re anything like most ecom founders… 

You don’t have a traffic, product, or creative problem. 

You have an OFFER problem. 

And you solve it in the absolute laziest way possible… 

% discounts. 

Which is why none of you can ever scale. 

Let me give you my entire offer stack playbook for FREE: 


THE DISCOUNT DEATH SPIRAL 


Every time you offer a 30% discount, you teach your customers one thing: 

"I’m just gonna wait until it’s cheaper later." 

This DESTROYS full price conversions, pricing power, and LTV. 

When CAC rises (which it ALWAYS does at scale), discounts compress your margins at the exact moment you need them most. 


THE PERCEPTION MATH 


People value what they RECEIVE more than what they save. 

$20 off feels smaller than handing out a free product or mystery gift. 

Even when the cost to you is identical… 

But you need to realize that money has fixed value, products have perceived value, mystery gifts amplify anticipation, and “free” bypasses rational friction. 

Customers don’t check spreadsheets at checkout. 

They respond EMOTIONALLY. 

So a great offer feels richer than it does cheaper which is the whole game. 


THE STACK FRAMEWORK 


Every scalable offer stack follows the same structure… 

Hero product: 
- One primary SKU. 
- One clear outcome. 
- Zero confusion for them. 

Entry incentive: 
- Instead of “20% off” 
- Use BOGO, BXGY, or free complimentary product. 
- Keeps anchor price intact while bumping perceived value. 

Volume ladder: 
- Once they buy, reward quantity. 
- “Buy 2 = Free Shipping” 
- “Buy 3 = Free Gift Box” 
- “Buy 4 = Free Gift + Mystery” 

Non-monetary bonus: 
- Mystery gifts. 
- Limited exclusives. 
- “Only available today” 

The goal is to nudge the customers UP, not linear. 

And the best offer stack increases AOV without touching price. 


THE BUNDLE EQUATION 


Bad bundle = random products, forced kits, lots of choices. 

Good bundle = follows the rule of BELONGING TOGETHER. 

Think in terms of completion… 

Product → Enhancement → Protection → Usability. 

Never make the customer ask “Do I want this?” but “I need this!” 

Specific examples that print: 

1/ Skincare… 
Cleanser + Serum + Moisturizer = Complete ritual. 

2/ Supplements… 
Main product + Complementary stack = Max results. 

3/ Gear… 
Tool + Protective case + Premium upgrade = Full solution. 

If you implement BUNDLE LOGIC. 

It’ll kill refunds because customers understand why everything is included. 


THE AGGRESSION WINDOW 


Aggressive offers work super well, but they should NOT be permanent. 

Scenarios to use extreme stacks: 
- BFCM. 
- Major holidays. 
- Short controlled pushes. 

Brands die when they get addicted to aggression and normalize extremes. 

Either through insane deals OR % discounts… 

Many a brand has done $400K during Black Friday than struggle to do $80K in December because their customers were conditioned. 


THE REFUND EQUATION 


Refunds come from misaligned expectations...

Common mistakes: 
- Selling story instead of product reality. 
- Premium positioning with cheap fulfillment. 
- Overpromising outcomes the product can’t deliver. 

Blackhat offers put money in your pocket but ruin reputation. 

Never run an offer that makes your customers expect a miracle and your product delivers “pretty good” results because the customers will think “pretty good” is “very bad.” 

My rule of thumb: 

Your offer can only AMPLIFY value, but not invent value. 


THE AOV MULTIPLICATION 


Now for the tactical shit that actually increases AOV without killing margins: 

1/ Tiered free gifts… 
- Spend $100 = Gift A. 
- Spend $150 = Gift A + B. 
- Spend $200 = Gift A + B + C. 

(Customers will see the gap and automatically upgrade) 

2/ Threshold psychology… 
- “You’re $17 away from free shipping” 
- Triggers immediate incentive to keep shopping. 
- Always make the threshold just above average cart value. 

3/ Complementary upsells… 
- “People who bought X also need Y” at checkout. 
- Never add random products. Just logical ritual completions. 
- Make it a mandatory item they need to make main thing work. 

4/ Bundle discounts… 
- Individual items total $180, bundle price $149. 
- Saves them $31 but maintains higher AOV than 1-time purchase. 

5/ Quantity breaks… 
- 1 for $50 
- 2 for $90 
- 3 for $120 
- The math makes 3 feel like the best choice. 

Secret to multiplying AOV is to keep it all logical, not forced. 


THE PERFORMANCE METRICS 


Strong offer stacks show up in… 

- Higher AOV without higher refunds. 
- Stable conversion over time. 
- Strong repeat purchase behavior. 
- Lower reliance on discounts. 

Warning signs… 

- Refunds spike when offers change. 
- Conversion only works during promos. 
- Customers disappear after first purchase. 
- Extreme margin compression at scale. 

Your goal is to COMPOUND revenue rather than spiking it once. 

Example… 

Brand A:
Runs 30% off, does $200K/mo, 25% refunds rate, 12% repeat. 
12 months later… doing $190K with dying margins. 

Brand B:
Runs value stack, does $180K/mp, 8% refund rate, 34% repeat. 
12 months later… doing $420K with healthy margins. 

Short term spike blinded Brand A to the long-term destruction. 

Offers aren’t hacks to sell cheaper for short term gain. 

They’re leverage systems to protect margin, increase value, and long-term equity.
