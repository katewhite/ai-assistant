Most brands are basically just winging it. They're copying what they see other brands do without actually figuring out if it makes sense for their customers. Even the e-comm bros who are maniacally optimizing traffic costs aren't thinking about the bigger profit picture and all the merchandising and promotional decisions are still happening in the dark, often owned by different teams in a large brand.

So we are solving two problems: we educate brands that there are better frameworks for thinking about profit and how it drives their success, and we give them an opinionated way to test profit levers and serve targeted experiences that impact profit surface areas.

## What "platform" means

We've got some core competencies that we're really good at: price testing and serving experience variants to different audiences. The platform play is about taking those strengths and building related tools on top of them that solve common profit-related problems but leverage what we’re already good at.

These tools don't need every single bell and whistle that point solutions have. If we can get to 70-80% functionality but with better integration and a tool consolidation angle, that's a win. Brands get more workflow value from having everything work together seamlessly than from having the most feature-rich individual tools. 

## The PLG motion

It’s something every product team should think about, but they don’t have to specifically design for the lower end of the market. Making self-serve customers who skew smaller successful feels like something a horizontal team can handle - getting them installed and ready to start using tools at an entry level. We're not worried about non-linear revenue streams or scaling constraints right now, but we will need to explore those down the road. Let's just nail getting small brands up and running smoothly so we can focus our human capital on providing higher levels of service to strategic customers. 

## How Experiences could evolve

We impact various surface areas of a brand’s site through the core platform and tools that solve specific problems, like making driving AOV easier through using our components. Over time, maybe we blend testing and serving experiences together more and make it easier to add holdback groups to any experience. The current architecture isn’t working totally smoothly from a conceptual standpoint.  

I've been thinking about two things working together:

**Data-driven suggestions**: As Sitewide gets more mature, we'll be able to trigger brands to create experiences based on actual data from their business. So our suggestions become opinionated and tailored, not generic.

**AI-powered execution**: We use AI to make the config and QA of experiences way easier. The setup itself isn't meant to be educational - we want them engaging with the data and getting interesting ideas (both from our AI and their own analysis), then we lighten the load to actually get stuff configured and live in a way that matches their vision, plus give them a full picture of all the ways they are impacting their site. 

## Where we need to get better

We have a lot of headroom with targeting. We’re OK at pulling parameters out of other tools but the next level is real integrations. We need to invest in building custom reusable audience profiles and actually integrate with the marketing stack. Example: you should be able to just select your Klaviyo list segment directly from our tools. And you could save a targeting configuration once and reference it multiple times as a profile that maps to how your internal team talks about the segment. 

Building this would get us closer to dynamic personalization, where we’re matching the right experience to the right audience and then maybe acting on behavioral triggers to continue changing that experience or throwing them into a specific test. 

## The longer game

Over time, Intelligems can become more like a service a brand flips on versus a series of tasks they have to do. More and more of what we can offer becomes dynamic, and our sophisticated data insights prove out the value of that approach and give them a full picture of what’s going in their business. They can be confident we’ll identify opportunities proactively.  And we'll need to rise to meet expanded shopping surface areas, like AI commerce and whatever comes next in terms of moving beyond Shopify.

The throughline in everything we do has to be profit, and that's how we differentiate and win.
