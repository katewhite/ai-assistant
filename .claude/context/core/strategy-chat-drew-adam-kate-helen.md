Transcript:
 
Me: Cool. So quick chat, I guess, because I I could only find half an hour for us earlier today at, like, in history, you were like, not Friday. Move it up. So here we are, and we could always do follow ups.  
Them: sort of extended amount.  
Me: But yeah,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: What's that?  
Them: So we can also extend it tomorrow.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. You're you're still here. Right? So  
Them: I'm still here for a little while. I'm just, like, let's just do everything sooner.  
Me: Yeah. Cool. Alright. Well, yeah, let's get started. So, Adam, it sounds like you have learned a lot at the the conference in terms of, like, the just the narrative and and the feedback that you've gotten. Right?  
Them: Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I've learned a lot. But had interesting conversations Some of them, I think, informed a little bit by, like, how also I was framing some of the questions. But I yeah, I mean, it was, shared most of the the thoughts that were relevant in that thread. But, yeah, I mean, thinking about just thinking about big market opportunities and, like, where there are dollars that are worth chasing and, like, you know, it was it was Ed from Klaviyo specifically who was, like, framing it this way. But I was like, you know, he was like, so we buy $50,000,000 in revenue. Like, Is that a real data point, by the way? That's what Keigh said. I I I have to believe he has, like, decent intel. Rough order of magnitude. But I anyway, so he he was just like, you know, it's nice. It's not like nothing wrong with $50,000,000, but, like, like, if the goal truly is, like, hey. We wanna be building towards something that could one day maybe, like, go public. Like, that's, like, good step along the way. Like, you'll have to find more things to, like, layer in  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: on top of.  
Me: It makes sense. Yeah. I I did like the the sort of the AI first year concept. Like, that definitely resonated. Like, there's a lot more we could do there. We started looking at, you know,  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: some of the stuff this morning with Craig on, like, AI test creation and some, like, conceptual stuff. And know, I think everybody's kind of, like, heading in that direction.  
Them: That that line, like like,  
Me: But, yeah, I mean, I think the  
Them: scared me a little bit, but I think in a good way of which line? That's  
Me: What was scary?  
Them: first AI first year. It's just like it's a very different approach. Like, it requires changing a lot. And but, like, I think it's what has to be the case. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, and there's a period of time where, like, you still support the the core of what we have today. Right?  
Them: Wait. Sorry. Say that again, Juan.  
Me: No. I was just saying there there's a period of time, like, we can be building sort of net new stuff with AI, and there's still a period of time where we have to support what we have. Right? And that doesn't mean we go and, you know, polish it like a diamond, obviously. But it's like, okay. We're still gonna keep the lights on on the way things work now while we're figuring out some of these sort of more future forward forward things and then figuring out how to, like, pull them in in an incremental way. So it's not like we wake up one day and, like, the whole product is, you know, completely changed. By the end of the year, hopefully, it feels that way. But I think  
Them: I feel oh, sorry.  
Me: No. Go ahead.  
Them: I was thinking about what exists today as the block that need to be in place for the AI to actually leverage and use. Which is what I was attempting with the horizon Horizons thing, which now Yeah. With that word. But it's like, you know, let AI do what it can with what's there already. Keep building more for AI to work with. And then but I don't see it being like, yeah, a rip and replace or a dramatic, like, oh, now we're AI first. This is more of a thinking and a framework and a cult almost like culture mindset to be Yeah. Not for AI first, Therefore, every single thing like, this is a completely exaggerated example, but, like, Emily's thinking about onboarding. Should the first thing you see via chat box, it's like, hey. What were you gonna send to the agency if you hired an agency? What are you trying to solve? And then, like, does its thing to set stuff up. Like, again, exaggerated, but that's very clearly AI first. In what you're thinking.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: No. I'm kinda in the same way of, honestly, like, your Mixpanel presentation yesterday where it's like, hey. Everything we release now needs to have like, instrumentation on it. Like, that's just how we're gonna operate now. And I was like, hey. Everything how does this fit into agentic usage agentic optimization of your of  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: site? And and, like, yes, they're all gonna be usable by humans as well, at least for a while. But like, that's that's where we think this is going. The I I I maybe lifting this somewhat from your memo case, but I was just doing, like, what kinda onboarding session with with some of the folks who started, like, three or four weeks ago. And like, the the Vino was asking questions around, like, well, like, what do we have? Product market fit. On, and and and how do we, like, know what problem someone is coming to us with? And it relates to this, like, owning pixels discussion. But it's kind of like we have levers and handles. Right? That is the that's this surface area. And the widgets and the checkout blocks and the this and the offer And AI is not gonna go build those from scratch each time. So it's on us to build the handles that are ergonomic and smart and useful and work together provide data in the same format, but then each of those handles needs to be operable by an agent at some point.  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: Or operable with an agent. I know. I like that Exactly.  
Me: That makes sense.  
Them: Anyway, I mean, one of things I was thinking about, even after I read everything, shared my responses, I'm like, have been reflecting on all the stuff, like, I also wanna be, like, too reactive and, like, we kinda just set our pillars and our strategy. And I think that a lot of the stuff falls in into that road map and that strategy. So I wanna, like, blow everything up at the moment. But I definitely think that, like, working on and, like, thinking about and brainstorming this framing is helpful as we probably will, like, December towards the end of the, like, this sprint of features and, like, adoption and some metrics. Think we'll wanna probably do a little bit of a reset and, like, frame up what's to come in 2026 and, like, that strategy looks like. But yeah, I mean, the main reflection is increasingly feeling like thinking about AI as a way to replace work that humans do is on a high having higher and higher and higher and higher conviction. About that. So I don't know, like, exactly what to do with that. And then all the other stuff of, like, is the platform, like, the set of APIs that we build on top of or the suite of tools or some combination of both and, like, do we do on a eighty twenty, and what is really 80% of the feature set and things like that. Like, you know, I I don't know. Like, there's probably not an answer to that and, like, well, that feels like we can, like, figure that out as we go and just be cognizant of it all. I agree with Helen's comment that, like, I think the platform is bow. I like, that feels like a false juxtaposition. I actually think, like, like, it it is the same way the handles are operable by AI. They are controllable by API as well. Like, that's, like, and you can build into this or on top of it or use it out of the box, but, like, our our I think those, like and it's different Again, this is it's kind of a result of us having really big and really small customers, but, like, hey. Here's the, like, easy version or you can go play around with all the underlying stuff if you wanna control it. And I do think externalizing things is, like, very helpful. I mean, I keep coming back, like, coming back to the feeling I have when I first saw Christian's AI workflow builder and that. It's like, what could we make external for this? Like, just and charge people for it, but just pay. Like, go fuck around with this agency and figure it out.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, there like, a really silly example yesterday, but Christos was demoing quantity buttons, and somebody was like, I want the button to appear for the variants to appear as, little chips instead of drop downs, and I'll pay your developers to do that. And it's like, well, no. But if we had, you know, the ability to go and let some external agency be like, for this customer, you know, we're gonna use your primitive, and then we're gonna, like, use, you know, the same data. We're gonna receive it, but we're just gonna make this one part look a little different. Like, okay. Amazing. Like, I don't care.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Like, do I think value in us building, you know, every last customization? Like, absolutely not.  
Them: I think it also I'm I'm parroting a point that Jake made, like, year ago, one of our four meetings, but, like, having those APIs exposed or, like, in this more primitive format, it can potentially it gives us more flexibility long term if we're not Shopify focused Yeah. Forever. Like, we are a lot of these widgets and the levers, they do make us more ecommerce centric. Right? And, like, steeper into the best practices of today built on Shopify, I'm okay with that. I like I don't know. Yes. We need to go after hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue and that, and those are great points from Ed. But, like, we gotta make a shit fucked ton of money for these brands today. Like, that, like, I don't wanna spend effort on things that expand our potential market size, and we have so much market size in front of us. And if we get amazing fans and create amazing value for them, we can go solve the expansion problem. Like, I I I believe that. We could debate it, but I believe that. So, like, you know, I'm totally fine with that extra platform dependency. But if we have that API driven, it makes it like, alright. Great. We now have, like, a different socket that needs to line up for it for a SaaS use case. For a travel use case and, like, you know, we've we've forced ourselves to build it in such a way that it won't be the biggest pain in the ass to where it's where Yeah. I mean, which is go ahead. Who is your thought? Not dissimilar from my thought. I left a note on, like, what does AI driven commerce look like? It is a big question. It will impact us. I think it's gonna take a couple years to settle in I don't think we're gonna be I don't think we have agency that change that. I think that is largely an external force upon us. Will it be helpful to, like, be where the puck is moving? Yes. But my inclination is, like, probably not worth calories right now to, like, speculate. We'll get more data on it. And, like, if we're prepared, we'll be able to jump on opportunities as they come. But, like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: yeah.  
Me: Did you see my comment back through in the Notion at all? Because I was basically, like,  
Them: No. I didn't.  
Me: we need to send this  
Them: I'm so bad on notion comments.  
Me: I know it's not. It doesn't notify you. It's the weirdest thing. But, essentially, like, my my take is, like, it's not that we need to go build for it explicitly, but we do need to develop internal expertise. I mean, maybe we have, like, a couple people who are, like, are going to, like, actually, like, actively research this and, like, report back to the company once a quarter or maybe, you know, like, through your network, like, the investors, like, maybe we could connected to people who are doing the most cutting edge thinking in that space, and we have, like, regular sort of updates and calls and things like that. Because it's just it's a fast moving thing. Right? And, you know, Shopify is out there thinking all kinds of thoughts and doing all kinds of things with, you know, their catalog and stuff like that. And it's just like, I wanna make sure we have, like, pipeline of knowledge coming to us, you know, more than trying to, like, anticipate a specific condition.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. That's fair. All the people thinking about it right now, though, it's like there's very little do The thinking to doing gap is so  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: wide that, like, I'm I'm probably overly jaded. But, like, the people doing the most thinking are not people I respect at the moment. So it's fair. I'm probably overly jaded, and that's a good push.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, I think where it comes down is, like, content on PDPs just starts to matter a lot more. Right? And so that could be one angle  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: when we talk about content testing, when we talk about optimizing PDPs. Right? So, like, it's it's more like just knowing how the moving part kinda put together because I do think it's gonna become a concern. For our customers, and we wanna have an answer ready even if it's not that, like, we have a specific product that, you know, is tailor made to this. It's more like, you know, hey. Here's how you can use what we are have for some of these concerns that you have.  
Them: Yeah. One Drew, going back to the point about, like, the Beyond Shopify like, it it was helpful. Like, I used to dismiss what Jake was saying, and, I mean, I've you've heard me say, like, that's, like, a luxury that prob like, that's a a luxury problem that Klaviyo has because they've hit 500,000,000 in revenue and, like, okay. Like, now what? But I do think that, like, well, as I was talking to Ed and, like, thinking about, like, market size and revenue opportunity, like, the the the market size for testing and personalization and stuff like that, even within commerce, is much smaller than the market size and opportunity for, like, email marketing and, like Yeah. Mass. And so, like, and, like, one one of the framings that Ed had as he was, like, thinking through this, he was like, could you sell to, like, Pizza Hut? Right? What would Pizza Hut buy from you? It was like, and and that was a really helpful framing. He was like, you know, do you think Pizza Hut has an agency, like, a a data that is looking at its conversion file or, like, optimizing its site or optimize It's like, certainly does. Right? And it's like, those are so anyway. So that was, like, kind of as I'm thinking about one of the questions in my mind that again, I I think it we don't have answer it now, but I'll, like, throw it and pose it as a question that I'm gonna, like, be thinking about as we think about, like, building out more of the handles and the levers, that, versus, like, maybe juxtaposition isn't, like, it's only juxtaposition or or or these two things are only opposing in the sense of, like, competing resources. Versus, like, going real really deep on that, like, what is an agentic product and how do we build the UX around, like, here's a very narrow thing. That I'm gonna, like, let this machine help me optimize where, otherwise, I would have had a human do it. I don't know. That kind of thinking and how to, like, balance between those two things. I think, like, for now, it's still a little bit of both. And, like, to Drew's point, there's a Sorry. I I I I lost you on the way of of what's being juxtaposed. The juxtaposition would be like, continuing to build horizontally the value creation levers that work really, really well in Shopify ecommerce. Yeah. If there's going deep to agent to versus something that's, like, a bit more narrow but is, like, can we, like, analyze your data and your conversion funnel and then act on that analysis and implement tests Like, can we be your agentic growth platform? I was talking to that woman, Amanda, who, like, basically ran growth at Quizlet. And, like, the way she framed us, like, her framing of us is, we are a growth platform for our customers in the sense that, like, we think about, you know, internally, how do we get our activation funnel and our monetization funnel and our retention strategy our product upsell motion and cross sell and adoption, that's how we think about, like, our growth internally. We might use tools for that, like Chameleon or whatever or Iterable or Braise, etcetera. And then, like, but we are that for our customer. Really interesting. Like and how could we be like, our customers might hire an agency to be the growth platform, and how do we, like, make that agentic  
Me: I don't need  
Them: and  
Me: I have a lot of  
Them: anyway yeah. That that right. There there's that's a big market beyond just Shopify. Yeah. Yeah. And you can charge a lot for it because, like, today, that work is being done by human.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Anyway so so the juxt the objective addition is, like, yeah, the the horizontal value levers for the Shopify brands versus, like, we could take something more narrow. It's not necessarily more narrow, but, like, your growth your activation, your conversion funnel and, like, being the growth agent on top of that.  
Me: Yeah. It's definitely portable.  
Them: Anyway, mean, that's a big vision. That's a big  
Me: Yeah. I think it's okay. Like, I think people are looking for us to come big internally too. Like, I'm not an interest chat the other day with Fever from customer support, and he really wants to get into products. So he books time with me, like, every few months or whatever. And was like, so what's the product strategy? And I was like, were you at the weekly team meeting last week on Friday? And he was like, yeah. And I was like, oh, oh, so, you know, were your takeaways from that? Like and he was like, he just couldn't repeat it And I'm like, okay. This is kind of, like, we've gotta dial in, like, what where where are we going? How does this work? And he honestly, the thing that stuck with me the most was Drew, something that you said in the mission, vision, and values about, like, look. This is my vision for the Internet. And, basically, like, every experience is, like, customized individually for for you. And he was like, that I remembered. You know? So, like, I do think we need something that's, like, anchored, like, kind of bold and far out.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then obviously, like, we're gonna have to do, like, a lot of repetition on, like, okay. Well, you know, here's the steps on how how we get there. Like, it might be  
Them: Increasingly, I'm we've been using the term traffic growth platform and it means all sorts of different things and all sorts of different ways. But, increasingly, I'm really liking this concept of, like, using the analogy of, like, we think about how we think of ourselves, how we think about the approach to growth at Intelligems, not in the b b to c sense, but, like, in the b to b sense. And then, like, you could think of extending that, and, like, that kind of CRO agencies are the extension of that. In the d two c world. And it's like, how can we do what they're doing and be the tool for that and, like,  
Me: Why  
Them: eventually, like, automate as much as that as possible. I mean, that is kinda, like, exactly what we've been saying, but I just I like that analogy and the framing of, like, to the to at least to me, I'm, like, a lot more familiar with the, like, b to b or, like, SaaS model versus the b to c model from the perspective of, like, growth. But I think that it works well in the d two c model. I'm I'm you may need to restate it for me. I wouldn't say  
Me: I'm probably  
Them: compelling to me. Okay. Okay. Let me I let me write it down. Also, like, I'm I'm I'm, like yeah. I keep looking over here. Nikki's coming up the elevator. So let me see if Donald can help her again in the building. Just pass off the baby to Donald. Yeah. Exactly.  
Me: Yep. Can bounce. He's got the calf strength.  
Them: Donald. I do I unblur? She might be an excuse, There we go. Yeah. I was just doing another onboarding session, and I I don't know if I've done this for you guys, but, like, the the, like, the bull's eye where it's like, alright. Yeah. Right now, we're in This is horrible. We're in, like, d to c commerce on Shopify 80% of your sales are through the online channel. AOV under $500. Not certain types of headlists. I'm like, okay. Step one, fill in and that sort. Like, go create more value, create our our fans there. Then you have, like, retail commerce. Hey. We can, like, make sessions more profitable here on bestbuy.com and Home Depot and you know, Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Magento. And then eventually, there's, like, everything else being sold online, has more layers. Which is, like, travel and SaaS and education and media, like, all those other things could be in the route too. But it's like the linking thought is  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: more profitable and efficient. Online  
Me: The guy that we're  
Them: funnels, journeys, sessions, whatever you wanna call it.  
Me: At one point, he was like, so our mission is to help help people make more money? So  
Them: Yeah. I do feel funny saying that one, but it's, you know,  
Me: And was like, it's.  
Them: be more profitable.  
Me: Yes. It's capitalism.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We are doing the capital.  
Them: That's it's like also any company has a mission itself to make money. Is kind of an iron irony. Yeah, Adam. I do agree. There's, like,  
Me: So  
Them: you know, Pizza Hut. Like, offer fit in and of itself. This is a friend a company Adam's friend was at, but mean, they sold. They didn't go public, but, like, big enterprise customers will pay a million bucks a year for better growth and promotion decisions. Like, that's all this thing did. It was like, hey, ADT. Give us your customer base. We'll tell you who to send from us to and when. Alright. I have to jump to an interview. And I'm passing the video off as we speak. So I'll talk to you guys Well, I'm gonna write down some of the thoughts so it's a little more concise.  
Me: Yeah. Awesome.  
Them: Alright.  
Me: Well Alright.  
Them: I'll talk to you soon.  
Me: Drew, do you want more time tomorrow, or are you feeling good? We'll wait for Adam to write something up, and then we can kinda, merge merge write ups or whatever.  
Them: I don't. Don't care. Like, I'm not really sure what our end result is, so I'm happy  
Me: I don't think anything changes necessarily in short term because, like, I don't think we're off track on the pillars and stuff like that. I think it's, like, build our butts off, basically, the like, with the stuff we've  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: committed to and keep learning in the short term. And then I really wanna get ahead of is, like, sort of dialing in. Like, what's the story for 2026? And Kate had a lot of really good questions, you know, being new and not having heard this, like, a million time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: We've evolved our thinking. Like, when we first started talking about this, it was, like, December, you know, with with Kim, and we were like, okay. Where are we going? That's where we landed on know, from profit optimization, which everyone was like, what? To profit growth platform because it's, like, sort of more all encompassing. So we've been, like, laying the groundwork to, like, make that true. You know?  
Them: Yep.  
Me: And I think we're on a good clip, and I think it's gonna explode when we get sight wide out and when we get some more of the adjunctive stuff out. Like, that combination is just it's so powerful. And I think that's gonna really go well. I think there's a lot of stuff internally we're gonna have to dial into. Like, I've been digging into churn and kind of doing more forensics into, like, what actually happened in accounts, you know, with certain churn reasons. And like like, all of our systems have to work together, and, like, we just have to take a comprehensive approach to retention in the first place. Like, I think we're building in enough value in what's gonna  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: really screw us is the retention piece and, like, not understanding how all those parts fit together.  
Them: Which at least, screw us. It's not the retention piece, but it's the adoption piece that if we don't get right,  
Me: Right.  
Them: leads to more retention.  
Me: Yeah. Exactly. But it's like even going through the churn reasons, like, I I did some digging and I was like, oh my gosh. Like, all these, like, short term use case ones, like, are we are we selling inappropriately? Kim and I were going back and forth. I'm like, oh, are we missing, you know, a product to meet people where they are for, like, test packs and stuff like that? I initially went and dug in, it was like, oh, actually, no. Like, I think people might be checking that reason off to, like, get us to fuck off and not try to, like, sell them more after they churn. Because when you go in, it's not there was a lack of trying or a lack of use, and there's nowhere where it's, like, explicitly stated. You know, like, in their notes or, you know, in calls or anything. Like, oh, well, really wanna do two tests, and then we're out. And it's like, there's a lot of friction and back and forth is what I'm finding. Like, they have billing issues. They have support questions with, like, tests set up so that the we do it for you thing is, like, even more powerful as a a concept. And there's, like, a lot of friction in in using the product.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Some of that is, like, in app that we absolutely have to fix, and some of it is, like, our internal systems, you know, from integration and onboarding and like, all the handoffs are not clear. Like, support got slow, you know, when I think when Hannah stepped stepped out. Like so, like, we're working on it, but it's like all those things matter too.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. When I hear short term use case, well, that that's interesting to hear your observations. I'd I'd be curious. Because Kim's perspective is very much like, oh, I can go back and watch  
Me: I only know when the. Right.  
Them: the calls and it was clear that they like didn't necessarily have the resources to go. Long term, but or yeah. Go ahead.  
Me: Well, so that's what I was going to pull, calls for Kim, basically, to be like, go listen to, like, these five calls if you do nothing else. Right? And what I found when I researched the accounts in HubSpot, was like, oh, there kind of isn't like a a single thing. It's like each stage was weak.  
Them: Totally.  
Me: And so, like, we have  
Them: Is  
Me: to tighten that up at each stage.  
Them: yeah. Which is and there's things in the product too that, like,  
Me: Totally.  
Them: create those back and forth is, like, you know, Andrew is a big advocate of, like, the paper cut theory, I like I believe. And and I've you know, we had a one star review yesterday, and it's like, okay, Sarah. Go dig into it. It's like, well, there's all these and forths. And, like,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: nothing went wrong at one place, but it was just like, lots of things where, like, it we missed something in QA or this, and it's like, you know, there's I've asked both Sarah and then Jen to try to pull these cases where it's like, there is all this back and forth. Because I I think sometimes we get on the ops side, it's like, well, within this framing, what's the best version that it could be?  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: And it's like, that's not the right framing. The right framing is like, how can this be magical or, like, we shouldn't accept that it was inefficient back and forth. It should be, hey. Like, can we just take this off entirely? So where can but then it's it's so hard because so many things could cause a favor. Cut. So that's one thing. It's like, I'm trying to actually, like, pull stories from my teams of what are these paper cut experience we need to give that feedback back. But I think that's just the stuff that is, like, grains of sand that just pass like, well, that's just how it is.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So that's one thought.  
Me: That's why, like, I'm digging into the tickets that are attached to some of these things because I'm like, okay. So So what are those paper cuts? And, like, you know, there's some commonalities like, okay. Shipping That's hard. It's hard to set up a shipping test. And then there's some things that are almost like not worth chasing aggressively right now because if we're about to have, like, AI tests creation, then it's, like, do you go solve every little  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: you know,  
Them: AI QA is probably pretty good to sweet.  
Me: every little now. I gotta do it pretty sweet.  
Them: Case.  
Me: Yeah. Kate and I were talking  
Them: And then the way I like, I think effort is on or or short term use case. Is on some continuum with, like, effort. Like, when I say this is a short term use case, what I'm really saying is, like, I didn't have more things to do right now given how much effort it takes me to do things and the opportunity cost of that upside  
Me: Yeah. It's doing.  
Them: versus other things. Like, if it was effortless, like, bet a lot of these people would have other things that they would do.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But that answer and so that's where, like, you know, why I'm excited about the agentic stuff is, oh, we can five x the market because effort is the reason people don't do these things. Because you have to, like, and I've been rude. You guys have probably heard me repeat this so much time. Alright? So sorry. But, like, I have to fucking advocate to my team to come up with this idea. We have to sit through a meeting then we have to stack rank these by impact, confidence, and effort. I have go do that. We pull out. Now I go design this, and I have to do it back and forth on the design of this new landing page. With my agency. A dev has to code it unless I can act actually, like, set it up in a no code way. I need to plug that into Intelligems and double check the targeting. I have to QA on mobile. I have to QA on desktop. All of that to then go and send it to my boss who has to get the thumbs up. Press go. And then I'm sitting and waiting, and then I'm refreshing, which is great. This is fun. Now I have to go back to that meeting need to go analyze the results and take those and say, yeah. Can we get approval and then press rollout? Then get that into the development pipeline and then have my developer send it, and they fuck something up. And then it's like, yeah. Okay. If that and that's for a content test. And so, yeah. Okay. That's a full time job. So some companies have prioritized that and others haven't.  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: But, like, all that's just like, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's amazing.  
Me: Yeah. That's magical.  
Them: Yeah. I was talking to you at this event last night, and Kate and Lane was like, there. And she was like, yeah. It seems like we just test something all the time. Like, we've just decided that that's a great way to do it. And, like, we totally believe that it should be evergreen if you have someone dedicated to it. And some other brand that was there was like, what? Like, you guys have you don't run out of things to test? We always just assume it's like it was a very funny interaction, boozer.  
Me: Super interesting.  
Them: I'll exit my soapbox.  
Me: Yeah. But so much to dig into, basically. But  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: yeah, Cool. Well alright. Kate, did you get what you wanted out of the conversation? Like, or is there any any point you want? Like, Drew's input on or anything like that?  
Them: Yeah. I mean, there will be. I think my, like, motivator in all of this and even in writing the thoughts down is what I've mentioned to you, Helen, and what you started getting to with the Sievert example is, like, there's gotta be something that the company, like, rallies around and understands. Like, on statement, it's there's, like, I'm envisioning and I'll probably write something almost faked up with our ideas, but, like, not intended to be set in stone. But it's like, product vision statement product strategy statement, Drew, was giving an example to Helen. One that I can remember at customer.io, don't remember how long it lasted, maybe a year or two years. But, like, our kind of, like, thing that we all talked about on the strategy for that time frame was that our customers send all of their messages to their customers via customer IO. And so from a product perspective, made it very easy to, like, prioritize. Okay. That means we're not focusing much on analytics. We're not trying to tell there were a million things we could have done. It was more like we need them to be able to get all of their users into our system. We need to implementing other channels that they want to reach their customers on. Like, it made it very clear what the focus was for that year or two. But it was, like, even this many years later, I could still tell you it was, like, all messages sent through customer IO. There was a very succinct but focused statement. So I I'm kind of pushing on, like, what would that be for 2026. Like, the AI stuff is super exciting, I think that's more of a culture mindset vision whereas there still has to be, like, what are we gonna focus on? Yeah. In order to, like for just the year. Right? And that's gonna help prioritize when you're down in a road map conversation, and it's gonna it's gonna be the thing we're confident is gonna push the business in the right So that's kinda what my dream world would be is, like, the strategy statement. Yep. I like it. I mean, I think if we can get something like that, great. I mean, that's kinda why, like, on offers, I'm like, can they should send every offer to it and, like, what what do we need to do to uphold that? You know? And that's that won't be the whole road map. Right? And I I'm not even you guys and and Adam should have your own perspective on if that's right. But, like, If we're gonna push it, that's a really nice motivating clarifying metric. Mhmm. Yeah. So yeah. I mean, I I don't wanna underestimate the difficulty of that here because I do think breadth is a strength of ours. And a weakness. It's one of those things where, like, yeah, the, like, horizontalness of the platform is, like, a power and a challenge. Like,  
Me: Mhmm.  
Them: and but I I I think there's also ways to, like, capture that in a in some of these metrics and strategies. So  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: yeah, I'm excited to jam on that.  
Me: Yeah. That was sort of to my point about when you are building a platform, you going to intentionally decide which of the tools that you're building have to be amazing. You know, because they are so directly linked to your your core competencies or they're adding a new core competency for you versus, like, where do you have to get to, like, 70 to 80% parity  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: with the point solution? And then you're always gonna get the feedback of, well, it doesn't do this. It doesn't do this. So, you know, the frontline teams are gonna feel that part. Right? And they're kinda they're gonna be like, well, people want quantity buttons, but they want, you know, this little doodad on them. And and we're gonna be like, awesome. Thanks. You know? But and, like, the way around that is opening the platform, right, so that somebody can go build that with their own developer if they really, really, really wanna do that. But I think that was like, was like, why aren't are you all gonna fix all these little paper cuts? And I was like, some of these surface areas are gonna kinda go away. Because we're about to, like, do things very differently. So, like, we're not prioritizing know, every single peep needs to feed that that comes in. Because we're sort of pivoting off of the way certain things are done. And so I think the frontline teams are definitely to sort of understand you know, what do they bring up and when do they advocate for something. You know? So  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: it was an interesting perspective to get.  
Them: Or, like, how to say no too is what a strategy can help with. It's like, oh, no. We're not gonna do that, like, really niche thing on the quantity buttons because  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: we are you know, in this area or making this other thing amazingly better or what like, it just  
Me: Can be, like  
Them: does make  
Me: look look at what you can get out of your your analytics now, and look. You can go it'll tell you what to test. And, like, that's, like, way more valuable.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Yeah. I like  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we could say now with with a suggestion, opinion of what they should do. Mhmm. Go spend your time here. Or go use an API to do whatever that.  
Me: Yep.  
Them: Mhmm.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Cool. Great. Yeah. I mean, feel free to grab your time with me on this whenever.  
Me: I  
Them: But, like, I like the push.  
Me: Yeah. I think we should just jam periodically. Like, it's it's a good conversation. To have and, like, remember to stay stay up here because it's very easy to be down  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: every day.  
Them: Yeah. Agreed.  
Me: Cool. Alright. Well, I will see you all at  
Them: Cool.  
Me: Thank you  
Them: Thanks, Alex.  
Me: Alright.  
Them: Bye.
