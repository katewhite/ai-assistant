Fall 2025

>>Craig Phillips	00:00
Yeah, like it's like we were out today and just went to like a costume store and the costume stores are full of people but it's mostly like, Yeah, It's like people going who are like invited to parties like it's not really like trick -or -treating is not really a thing but people get invited to parties and they wear whatever and they just dress up and act stupid basically so. Right. And yeah, you'll see like a group of teenagers walking around the city all But they're like And it's funny I was out today and there's like groups of like seven like, you know, probably 17 year old, 18 year old guys walking around but they all have matching costumes like that's not the thing, right?

>>Angel Austin	00:35
That's interesting. Yeah.

>>Craig Phillips	00:40
Hey guys. Was a costume day at school today?

>>Adam Kitain	00:47
Um, so my kids go to like a Jewish school so they actually don't, it's like some I don't know I guess like, yeah, they don't, don't do that.

>>Craig Phillips	01:00
Do they still go trick -or -treating at night though?

>>Adam Kitain	01:01
Yeah, we're gonna go trick -or -treating. Cool. One second. There's one thing I was thinking about, I've been thinking about things I wanted to talk about. Aha. I found it.

>>Adam Kitain	01:31
Oh, yeah. Do you know how I get from a, oh, I got it. Okay.

>>Adam Kitain	02:02
I'm ready. Good.

>>Craig Phillips	02:03
Okay. Cool. I'm sorry.

>>Adam Kitain	02:06
I mean, for the reschedule guys.

>>Craig Phillips	02:10
No, no, it actually worked out perfect because you and Andrew were there, I just flipped you guys and it worked out perfect, So yeah.

>>Adam Kitain	02:17
Oh, awesome. All good.

>>Craig Phillips	02:20
Um, yeah. So thanks for jumping on and taking the time. Um, yeah, I think you generally get a sense of what we're doing this week and the kind of calls we're doing. So, um, hopefully you kind of got the background there so we don't have to say more. But, um, yeah, if you want to, the floor is yours, um, to take this in the direction you want to go.

>>Adam Kitain	02:39
Okay. Okay. Uh, so what I was thinking is like kind of zooming really far back of like, I was trying to answer this question of like, if I knew what I know now, when we started, what would I have done differently? Like, that's like kind of the question that I'm trying to answer and think about, which is like a super loaded question, right? Cause like, it would have been impossible. Like we couldn't have known what we know now, uh, also the world is so different. And I was trying to remember like there, there, there's so many things. So that, so first of all, I think it's worth saying like, what do we know now? One like AB testing is like a really important thing for our customers. Like I never appreciated how important AB testing as a category for e -commerce was. Um, and, and yet, and still, uh, I think we have some data that like only 20 % of even Shopify plus brands, which are like Icp, um, have any AB testing software installed, right? Like, um, there's the vast majority of, of even bigger brands don't AB test at all. Um, I should verify that data, but like someone told that to me. Um, I, I was so like going back to like how much I didn't appreciate that AB testing could be big for e -commerce.

>>Adam Kitain	04:23
Like I didn't think e -commerce would have enough data. I didn't think they like would be doing this. I don't know. I guess like we also, when we started and like, I kind of wanted to make this point and this is what I was looking for when we started, it was not like, should we like do AB testing for pricing or AB testing for shipping rates? Or like, that wasn't the question. It was like, we want to help brands figure out their pricing. Should the approach be to like AB test it or like for us to help them figure it out dynamically. So I actually like.

>>Adam Kitain	04:58
Very few people have seen this. This was like one of my first ever Figma prototypes. And the idea was like, do you wanna do the A -B test route or do you wanna go to the pricing bot route? And this actually was a clickable prototype, but that doesn't really matter. The point was, if it was an A -B test, and this is like, no joke, our Ui looked basically like this for a while. So this, it was like, you choose your products, you choose your groups, and you fill in the squares. So that was like one thing that we were showing people. The other thing we were showing people, this was like the pricing bot. So you choose your goal, increase profit or sell inventory. So you chose profit. I wanna maximize profits on, you choose products, you upload your Cogs, you share your Cac while staying within these constraints, like maximum price, minimum conversion, or sell inventories, like I wanna sell through inventory by this date while staying above this minimum price. And that was like, so we showed this to people thinking that it was actually in, I believed that it was in the realm of possibility that people were gonna choose this. And everyone was like, f*** that, I want this. This seems way cooler. And that's kinda like why we ended up with A -B testing was because this is what people wanted.

>>Adam Kitain	06:44
The company would be very, very different if we went down this route. Another thought that I was thinking is like, if we were at the same time, and as much as A -B testing is important and really core to the use case that we provide, if we were gonna build an A -B testing product, and even as I was thinking about this, it's an interesting thought exercise of like, if A -B testing was what was going to define us, I would never in a million years wanna limit us to e -commerce. Like, A -B testing is so prevalent across so many different things. And I never thought that like, oh, we're just gonna go build the next big A -B testing platform. When we started, Optimizely was huge. And so Optimizely was like a multi -billion dollar A -B testing platform. There was Unbounce, which was like used by a lot of like growth, SaaS growth marketers that would like, Unbounce was basically like a landing page builder A -B tester, and it was for like marketers who were sending people to like landing pages. There was Launchdarkly, which was like a very developer forward, still exists, developer forward A -B testing platform that I was familiar with. Other platforms that I was not familiar with, but became familiar with early on were like Eppo, which was acquired by Datadog, Statsig, which was recently acquired by Ai. Anyway, the point is, is that like, there are a tremendous number of really mature, powerful A -B testing platforms.

>>Adam Kitain	08:37
And so if building an A -B testing platform and that being their like end goal was the end goal, which it's still like, I think isn't, is that it's kind of what I'm getting at. I would like have built it for like e -commerce is great, but like, I think we would go like very quickly beyond e -commerce and be like, well, we would be using it internally to A -B test our landing, our website and our app and like, and create SDKs for all sorts of people. So anyway, that's kind of like a few thoughts that I had coming into this. Maybe I'll pause there. And like, is there anything that super surprised people or like want to go deeper on?

>>Craig Phillips	09:32
I really liked that nuance. Yeah, I hadn't heard that thought before. I guess, is it sort of like, is there still a path do you think? So if, let me correct me if I'm wrong. So you kind of said if we're sort of defined by A -B testing as our thing, then we shouldn't be bound by e -commerce. So we would naturally expand beyond that.

>>Craig Phillips	09:57
But there are a lot of big players in that space might be tough to compete.

>>Adam Kitain	10:02
Yeah

>>Craig Phillips	10:03
So we're more in I guess like primarily were Positioned as a testing tool for e -commerce specifically Shopify. Yeah, then there's this question of experiences and is that is it sort of like expanding the pie within e -commerce is sort of the strategic angle here as opposed to Expanding the pie. Yeah ruling to other non e -commerce Yeah, Okay great

>>Adam Kitain	10:29
So let's like shift the angle the lens now to be a little bit more forward -looking than backwards looking One other thing that I would say that may be really quick That I was thinking about as like I was trying to remember all the things that I was thinking about coming to this meeting I also didn't appreciate in specifically an econ and like how important consumer grade sass would be and when I when we were starting So much of the advice we got And I think it was really really good advice And I'm not saying that I would necessarily have done anything differently But it was like Your product doesn't matter. It's the problem. You're trying to solve and like People almost tried to reframe like it's not product market that you're after it's like problem market fit And it's like is your like solution market fit like It like and people use the analogy that I still use all the time when I'm talking to really early stage founders which is like if Your hair like you want to find people whose hair is on fire And for those people have you guys heard me say this the hair on fire and the brick? Anyway, like There's this concept of if you if you meet someone and their hair is on fire Obviously the best thing you could do is give them a bucket of water But if you give them a brick They would happily take it. The implication is that like they would beat their head with a brick to try and Like put out the fire and obviously that sucks, right? Like you would be literally hitting your head with a brick, but it would be better than nothing and they would take that brick and Like try and put out the fire and then like eventually you can go build a bucket of water and like sell that to them

>>Adam Kitain	12:21
But like, you know, you've found a hair -on -fire problem if they're willing to take your brick and Which is like a pretty terrible solution to that problem and So Anyway, that was like so rooted in us, which I think was really helpful Which is why like we didn't put too much emphasis on like the product itself and more the problem And I think that that worked for us Really well up until around the point that we launched all of our content testing because I think at that point I mean, oh, Yeah It was gonna bite us at some point no matter what But that point was an inflection point of like a lot more scale a lot less sophistication of user a lot more like self -serve Up until that point which was literally more than two years after we started the company So for the first two years and Almost a million dollars in AR are About a million dollars in AR We We would know every single time someone launched a test like every time someone started a test We were involved I Mean which is crazy to think about I mean like now we want there's like 1 ,200 tests launched a week And we are very much not involved in all 1 ,200 even price tests like there are probably a hundred launched a week and we are not involved and so Anyway, I think Where was I going with that?

>>Adam Kitain	14:02
Yeah, the point is that I never appreciated how important consumer grade sass would be in this space that we're in That's another looking backward reflection, okay, so looking forward Like And Craig you use that like One interesting anchor is like the word experiences another interesting anchor is like To me and what would be like interesting beyond e -commerce is like the whole like monetization concept of like hey Pricing is a tough problem. Not just for e -commerce brands. Not just for direct -to -consumer but for everyone who sells stuff online and like What would that be? What would that look like to go after?

>>Adam Kitain	14:56
And one of the, I think it's like, to me, as I think about the, like, and Drew and I have time next week to talk about vision and reframing it. It's not going to be that different than what it is today, like slight changes in words. But I think there's like kind of two themes for me. One is around like decision intelligence and like being smart, something like smart, intelligent confidence decisions. That's a bucket. And the other is around like profit, yield, efficiency, like the market dynamics. Let me start with the first one. So I don't know if you have you guys done, have you guys done Alex yet? Or is Alex on Alex on yours? I'll like paraphrase a lot of the stuff that he says, which I like, which is land lands really well. A lot of this is like to existing customers and like how people relate to us, but like, don't don't guess no. So that's like a very strong testing, I think, oriented thing. Decide confidently, again, like pretty, pretty testing oriented.

>>Adam Kitain	16:40
Test beyond what's typical. What's interesting about that one is like also very testing oriented, but it goes into this like, you know, maximizing profit and yield and stuff like that. But the reason I like a little bit more of a like broader terminology here around like intelligence and like and smart is because I think what I believe that is that there's like value, not just in like you having a question and having to make a decision, but actually us surfacing the question and making the decision for you. So it's like it's not just like hoping you make the decision, but actually doing the making of the decision. And even one step further, not even making you have to be aware that there is a decision to be made and us just powering experiences. So like this is like that experience point. But I really do think that like here's a crazy, a crazy thing to imagine, which is like when people land on a site, the content they're shown, the images, the the the the pricing, the discounts, the offers, like the entire wrapper of the site is entirely one to one personalized. Sort of like how when you go to Facebook .com or Instagram, your feed is your feed.

>>Adam Kitain	18:23
Everyone's feed is different. It's based on like who you follow and who your friends are and like what ads you're shown. And honestly, like not even like even if you were all shown the same ads from the same companies, like you might even be shown different ads from those companies. Like it's just such a dynamic experience. Imagine that for sites. And while you that kind of exists, too, like in chat, you know, like if you got one of you and one of us And I go to chat to BT and like we're both looking for sneakers, we will probably end up like have a very different conversation with an agent about like what sneakers we should buy, like maybe because it has context that you're really athletic And I like to play soccer or something. I don't know. But it also might be that, you know, you're a woman or you're older or younger or, you know, end up saying something about like you care about style. So like the company like it will like anyway, I believe that there is going to be this like. What would be crazy to believe, which I like am optimistic could happen someday, is that like these sites are so dynamic that everyone's experience is completely tailored and personalized and one to one. That would be crazy. That is not. Because some growth person or e -commerce manager has like configured a tremendous

>>Adam Kitain	19:55
And this number of rules of like, if you come from this campaign, you see this picture. And if you come from that campaign, you see that picture. Like that wouldn't be feasible. No one would ever do that. It would have to be a much more like automated, you know, done for you. And that's where it's like, you're not making the decisions anymore. You're not even aware of the decisions that are being made. It's just smart. So like, anyway, that's like what I mean by this like smart thing where it's like, it's not just about decisions, it's about just being smart. I'm doing this all in real time. So I apologize that this is a little bit like not super crisp, something I'm working on. Like, these are new thoughts. The other like angle that I think is really important to tie in here is this like yield, profit, growth, efficiency markets, like something that is really like becoming more apparent to me recently. First of all, even from when we started, I believe that pricing is a huge lever that is underutilized by almost every business in every company. Like, I think that we as intelligence do a shitty job with our pricing. I think that most hotels are incorrectly priced. I think that most restaurants are incorrectly priced. I think that like most SaaS is incorrectly priced. Certainly most D2C e -commerce is incorrectly priced and pricing being the whole stack of like prices and discounts and shipping fees and taxes and like surcharges and all that kind of stuff.

>>Adam Kitain	21:39
That is like, that creates inefficient markets. I think that like some of the more efficient markets are the ones that are like tremendously high scale, tremendously high data. I don't know, what do I think are like the most efficient markets? Like commodities. So crops like corn, wheat, soy, gas, like around the country, like those are pretty efficient markets. I quite frankly do think that like Uber and Lyft are efficient markets. Like it's pretty interesting. Something that has happened even more so since we started the company than to now, like in the last five years, the parity between Uber and Lyft, at least in my experience, like is much closer. There used to be really big differences in pricing between Uber and Lyft, which to me was inefficiencies in the market. And like, you know, you can just open the app and Lyft might be really expensive and Uber might be cheaper, vice versa. And that was like an inefficient, that was representative of an inefficient market. Now, like they like track so, so, so, so, so closely. And I do think that that is a really efficient market. Not to say that I think that like buying a T -shirt online is gonna be like changes every time you refresh the page or like every day the price is different the way like the gas station might be. But I don't think that the way we buy Saas, the way we buy hotels, the way we buy food is as efficient as it could be.

>>Adam Kitain	23:28
When I talked to some of these e -commerce brands, something that's been happening recently, and I've said this refrain once or twice recently, and so if I'm repeating myself, apologies. But one of the things I've heard a lot recently in these like feedback calls that I've been doing is like, I'll ask often like, what are your goals for next year? What's the biggest rock? And they're like, well, our goal for next year is to hit, I don't know, 35 million in Topline, 5 million in Ebitda. Like we wanna grow traffic by 50%, grow our email like base by X. And like, and I'm like, okay, cool. Like you wanna grow your revenue, you wanna grow your profit, you're growing your traffic. Like what are the levers that you have to pull to hit that like that growth? And it's always about, I like sort of like, it's gonna skip this up here, but it's always about, yeah, growing visitors, growing traffic. It's like all about volume. And it's like more volume, more volume of people. And I'm like, what's so interesting to me is that in my mind, and actually, I mean, mathematically, if you think about how much profit your company makes, if your goal is 5 million in Ebitda, or 30 million in Topline, it's like billions.

>>Adam Kitain	24:54
Visitors times profit per visitor. It's like, that's how you come up with like, that's how much EBITDA you're gonna make, is like number of visitors times profit per visitor, or like visitors times revenue per visitor, and that's how much revenue you're gonna make. And so it's like crazy to me that like, all they're thinking about is how do I grow my visitors, as if revenue per visitor and profit per visitor are not levers that they can pull, as if like, that's fixed, and they can only pull the visitors lever to hit their targets, and not their revenue or profit per visitor lever, which I think is such a miss, because like, well, what if you could actually like, what if instead of having to, like if your goal is to double, instead of having to grow your volume, or even maybe more than grow your volume, because that then like, that traffic then becomes less and less high intent, and that like, revenue and profit per visitor goes down. Like, what if actually you could get a quarter of the way there or half of the way there by better revenue and profit per visitor? They're like the right side of that equation. And it's just something that like, people are not really thinking about. So their hair is not on fire, which is interesting, right? Like they like, don't appreciate that that's like even happening. But I think it's such a big opportunity. So anyway, I do think that like, I care a lot about not like, I care a lot about that piece of like growing profit per visitor.

>>Adam Kitain	26:36
And I think there's so many cool levers that you can do to do that. And I think like, that's, you know, testing and figuring out like what things work better, what experiences work better. Like there's a huge data component here of like, and that's like a lot of the site -wide analytics is like, hey, let's just like look at our data. The way like Emily is like looking at our data and we see like something changes week over week. Oh, I wonder if there's a bug. I wonder if there's like something like an image isn't loading or like it's outdated. Oh, it's like still a holiday image, even though it's like April or whatever. So it's like, there's data, there's testing, but it's also like delivering experiences. Like I've used this example before. There's this like Denver -based company called Feels. They sell one and a half milligram THC gummies. And I remember I asked him once what was the biggest unlock that he did. And it was a post -purchase upsell, which was like, if you bought a single one -time pack of gummies, as soon as you made that purchase, he would offer you a like five minutes to take advantage of a like 50 % off a second one. And like for him, the cost for that was super, super cheap because it's like he's already shipping one to ship a second, the incremental cost of that is zero. Like he's not trading off any conversion for this. Like it's impossible to be trading off conversion because you don't even experience it until after you've already converted.

>>Adam Kitain	28:19
So like everyone is already converting and like 40 % of people take up that offer, which is like 40 % times 50 % off. So it's like another 20 % more revenue on every single order. And so like his Aov went up 20 % overnight and that just like immediately is just like higher revenue per visitor. Like by like definitionally. And like those are the kinds of things where it's like, hey, what are the things that can just like increase your revenue and profit because like they just work, they create better experiences. The consumer wins because they're like, oh, hell Yeah, I get a second one for 50 % off. Like, why not? Like he wins because he's like able to achieve those efficiencies through shipping. Like everyone wins, win, win, win. That's efficient marketplaces. And so that to me is like an example of like, how do you grow that like profit per visitor, revenue per visitor without having to grow, you grow your crop on your bottom line without having to like grow the number of visitors to your site. And that's like broadly, like that's an experience. There's like so many of these like experiences that fall into that. Anyway, I have more time. I don't have anything after this. If you guys wanna keep going, this has been a.

>>Adam Kitain	29:53
A bit of a soapbox, but hopefully helpful.

>>Craig Phillips	29:57
That's great. That's kind of the point. Yeah, keep going for a little bit if you've got more things.

>>Adam Kitain	30:03
I don't have more things, but I mean, I've probably go forever, but I'm curious, like, maybe anything to clarify there or questions?

>>Emily Brown	30:15
Maybe just, I think Craig kind of asked this a little bit, but maybe to be a little more direct, you're, you are in favor of like deepening our solution to e -comm and by doing that, you think like experiences is the way to do that versus going now pretty robust testing platform for e -comm and like being like, okay, we're going to stick with that, but like we're moving out of e -comm very quickly.

>>Adam Kitain	30:49
I think that, I think that maybe a couple of things. And the answer could be both, but I actually think that there's like three here. There's like kind of a, it's a, it's a, it's a three -way path, not a two -way path. So one path is like be the best AB testing platform for every industry. Like just like the best AB testing platform in the world. Another is figure out dynamic pricing for others, like price optimization for other industries too. And maybe the third is continuing to go really deep into e -commerce on like this sort of decision and yield confidence. Of those three, I would say the second and the third are a tier for me above the first. So like be the best AB testing platform in the world is probably like a tier below for me. I think that AB testing platforms have been around for over a decade. We kind of know how this story plays out. Like we've seen the Optimizely story. We like, these people exist. It's becoming more and more, as much as it already has been commoditized, it's becoming more and more commoditized.

>>Adam Kitain	32:30
And, and, and I think that in the world of Ai and some like increasing abilities of automation, AB testing alone, again, like requires you to have a question that you want to make a decision on that you are now looking for an answer. And it's like, you lose this opportunity to like, it gets optimized for you. I think that AB testing might underpin some of those like optimizations for you. But I don't think that the goal is, or will be, be the best AB testing software across industries in the world. Now, if the question is, do we want to figure out pricing? So as I think about then, like the other paths in front of us, I believe that there is still a tremendous amount of value for our existing, for like the umbrella that we, of customers that we serve today. And like, we can like make a slightly bigger umbrella beyond Shopify, not even slightly, a bigger umbrella beyond Shopify. There are potentially even like bigger umbrellas beyond that. But like, I think that there's probably a lot of benefit to serving a narrower customer with a deeper product than lots of different customers with a narrower product.

>>Adam Kitain	34:16
I think that's like, I don't know if that is the exact right framing. But so the answer, I guess, Emily would be building experiences, building dynamic, intelligent, yield maximizing software is probably the goal. And I think that the way we get there, so that's like the goal. That's the vision. And I think the way we get there is by

>>Adam Kitain	34:53
Staying in e -commerce and building that for e -commerce and maybe at some point Expanding that horizon.

>>Craig Phillips	35:02
I think And it feels like there's still I mean like you said at the beginning so anecdotally at least 20 % of all of Shopify's customers are doing some form of testing And Then we have a chunk of that 20 % Amidst a lot of competition through a lot of obviously players in here and Having a good business in that So there's a feels like there's still plenty of growth opportunity even within that that niche that we sit in right now Yeah, and why?

>>Adam Kitain	35:41
Why is it only 20 % like if a brand isn't testing why not? My team is too small Like I don't like we're Really literally everyone thinks that they're the most efficient team in the world. No, they just like It's like a function of business. It's like you have to be efficient My team is really lean and efficient and so like it's not Someone's thing. It's too much work when we talk about I talk about personalizations, they're like everyone is like, Oh that's f****** awesome, but like Is the juice worth the squeeze who on my team is gonna do that? That's so much work to set up so much work to maintain like it's always about the amount of work involved Which is why I like to make it easier or even better automated is Like a huge unlock I Don't necessarily think that like you can just do that. I think there's probably like a lot of stepping stones I think there's like Let's make it easier and easier and easier and easier and easier and easier and easier until eventually it's like literally just does it for You right? Like if I think about self -driving cars, it was like Okay, like there's like lane Like stay in your lane buttons where it was like, Okay Like I can like Shift you back into your lane if you're drifting and then there's like Adaptive cruise control, which is like, Okay Like if the car in front of you slows down I'll slow down and there are all these like steps along the way and then now we're like you can take your hands off the wheel and it'll change lanes for you and it'll like, you know, maybe even like turn or whatever

>>Adam Kitain	37:27
And And then eventually it's like Okay now like literally there's like not even a person in the car. So I think that there's There are milestones along the way of like let's let's make it easier and easier and easier and easier until eventually it's like okay, like look mom no hands, I Don't think we can just be like Well, if the goal is automation like let's automate it tomorrow

>>Craig Phillips	37:54
Yeah You mentioned a narrower You mentioned a few things about that like the narrow the path of the narrow a customer with a deeper product Yeah, or what was the alternative?

>>Adam Kitain	38:07
This is a broader like customers with a narrower product.

>>Craig Phillips	38:11
Do you do you feel like?

>>Adam Kitain	38:14
Part of our strategy is to go more narrow in terms of our definition of like Icp Not as a more narrow, but I would say that our definition of Icp is like I Think some people would see it as narrow and so I Would say that like maintain that narrow as opposed to like try and serve Non Shopify stores non e -commerce stores, right? Like I was talking to this guy. This is company prescient Ai which basically like They were a co -sponsor of D to ski back in Fed where in March They serve all the same customers that we do say it's like Anyway, we don't get into what they do. It's like I'm marketing analytics Cool And it basically helps you figure out like How much you're spending across all your marketing channels and what's working well and what's not working? Well, and where should you spend more money in your marketing and it was like for e -commerce brands Who did he tell me he just signed? He said he just signed. I don't remember but it was like Not e -commerce, Okay, I want to say it was like Oracle like I It was it was like Certainly not e -commerce, but it wasn't even selling stuff online. It was like Sas company

>>Adam Kitain	39:51
Um, and so I think there are like, there's like, it's tempting to be like, you know, and that contract was like an eight figure contract. Like that contract alone was like more money than I make in a year. And like the company intelligence makes in a year. So it's really enticing to potentially one day go beyond e -commerce. But I think that we get a lot of value from serving a really narrow customer for now. Um, wait, another thought, um, is this is like really unstructured. I don't know. This is, I don't want to over index on this is like, we talk about a platform to me. What is like a platform and why a platform?

One thing I think Shopify did really, really well. Why like Shopify is, I mean, first of all, Shopify is like, you can't be a Shopify store without Shopify, right? Like you can't sell e -commerce, you can't sell online without Shopify or some version of it. Like no one is like building their own e -commerce engine. Um, so putting that aside though, one of the reasons why I think Shopify maybe differentiated itself from everyone else is because I see them as a platform. And what I mean by that is like, they have a multidimensional set of constituents. It's not just Shopify and the merchant merchant being like, let's say, you know, Kizzik shoes, it's Shopify, the merchant, tech partners, agency partners, all of whom like the agency partners and the tech partners like intelligence gets benefit by all of our customers being Shopify. All of the agency partners get a benefit by, yeah, all the agency partners have a benefit by like serving Shopify customers because like exactly the same, they can like build their own themes and build their own code and like use it over and over and over again and like have their own integrations and their own APIs. And so like, um, having like these other stakeholders where it's like, and then as a merchant, why would you choose Shopify? Well, it's like, well, I want the best AB testing tool and the best AB testing tools only on Shopify. And I want the best agency or this agency or this cheap agency or whatever.

>>Adam Kitain	42:37
And that agency wants me to be on Shopify. So like now the merchant is going to choose Shopify because the agency wants people to be on Shopify. The agency is going to want people to be on Shopify because it makes things simple for them. Like everyone wants to now like, just like do it the same over and over and over again. And, um, and so I think that like, I forget where I heard it, it was a Lemmy's, but it was a long time ago. But basically the concept was, and he was talking about like the strategy for, for LLMs. Like if I was an Llm chief strategy officer, like how would I try and create like be number one if I was like the head of ChatGPT or if I was the head of Cloud, like what is my strategy to be number one Llm? And his answer was like, get as many people into the platform as possible and building dependencies into that platform until they are like stuck. And eventually you have such strong network effects of all that stuckness. And he used the example of like Facebook and like, and then eventually like you can then charge those people for access to the rails and it may not be the consumer, it may be the third parties, right? Like it may be that the way ChatGPT makes money is like the, like is the partners that like tech partners that are like leveraging, like that are injecting their stuff into, you know, that are actually making ChatGPT better. Right? So it's like if I'm Zillow And I'm making the app, the Sdk into ChatGPT, so it's really easy to like find houses and like look at my house shop in ChatGPT.

>>Adam Kitain	44:25
That's good for me as Zillow because I know a lot of people already in ChatGPT and so like I want to be where people are. It's really good for ChatGPT because now there's like more value in ChatGPT and it's good for the consumer because everything is in one place, like everyone wins. But eventually like right now, ChatGPT would be silly to charge Zillow money to do that because Zillow would be like, I'm not going to pay you like for that necessarily, but like for free.

>>Adam Kitain	44:50
Free, they might do that. And eventually, one day, that might be like, where tragedy makes all of its money. So anyway, I say this, because like, third party Api's, which is like, what we're doing today, I think is like, agencies, like, we give agencies a break, we get like, we almost pay agencies to use intelligence, right? To be like, hey, like, you get a discount, we'll give you a referral fee to bring your customers to intelligence. But you might imagine one day, like, we can potentially monetize all our third party agencies, maybe we let them advertise and intelligence, maybe we let them like, build products and sell those products in intelligence, like, right, maybe we let them build a like, post purchase up sell that is like native into intelligence that they build and maintain. And like people can buy. And like that agency is not like or that tech partner is now making money because someone's buying that thing through intelligence. And maybe we take a cut of that, you know, like, I think that that there's like, a potentially really exciting play where getting everyone into intelligence is, creates a tremendous amount of lock in, but also a lot of like revenue opportunities in like 234 years.

>>Craig Phillips	46:17
Interesting stuff. Yeah. All right.

>>Adam Kitain	46:23
This went long.

>>Craig Phillips	46:25
I'm sure it could go longer. This is really, really awesome.

>>Adam Kitain	46:27
My coffee is starting to kick in. So like, when we started, I was, I was uncaffeinated. And now I'm caffeinated.

>>Craig Phillips	46:33
So cool. Nice. Yeah, well, then I guess we can we can wrap up there. Yeah, thanks, Adam, for taking all the time.

>>Adam Kitain	46:42
Guys, I'm so excited for this design sprint. And like the thinking here. I it is long overdue, and like excited to have really strong foundations to continue to build whatever comes next. So this is awesome. You're all going you're all going to be in New York in two weeks.

>>Craig Phillips	47:01
Awesome. Yep.

>>Adam Kitain	47:04
Probably won't be there.

>>Craig Phillips	47:06
Right?

>>Adam Kitain	47:06
Yeah, I mean, if I make it, it would be it would be very spontaneous last minute, but I probably won't.

>>Emily Brown	47:13
Too much FOMO. We just have to create so much Fomo.

>>Adam Kitain	47:19
Dude, honestly, like, um, I have so much Fomo. I had so much Fomo about missing the engineering offsite. We were talking about Enneagram personality types. This week when I was in New York. Um, I don't know if you guys know this about me. I'm like, a seven, which is the like, the fun, like, personality type that always wants to be a good time. And so, yeah, I definitely was part of the like, after after after party on Tuesday night. So I hope you guys have a good time. And if I'm able to make it, I will But we'll see.

>>Craig Phillips	47:59
Cool. Bye. Cool.

>>Adam Kitain	48:03
Talk to you later.

>>Craig Phillips	48:04
Thanks, everybody. Have a good weekend.
