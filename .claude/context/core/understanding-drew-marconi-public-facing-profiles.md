# Understanding Drew Marconi: Mindset, Values, and Vision

## Background and Vision for Intelligems

Drew Marconi is the Co-Founder and CEO of Intelligems, a SaaS platform
focused on **profit optimization for e-commerce brands**. With an
economics degree from Yale and early career experience at McKinsey, Drew
honed his analytical skills before moving into tech. He later led
marketplace pricing and operations at Via (a ride-sharing company),
where he learned the power of **dynamic pricing algorithms** and
experimentation at scale. This background shaped his vision for
Intelligems: **bringing the "learning, mindset, and toolkit" of big tech
companies like Uber and Amazon to independent online merchants**. In
Drew's own words, Intelligems exists to give e-commerce entrepreneurs
access to the same data-driven revenue optimization tools that fuel the
growth and profitability of industry giants.

Founded in 2021 (through Techstars Boulder), Intelligems initially
focused on **A/B testing product prices** to help merchants empirically
find their optimal pricing. Under Drew's leadership, it quickly expanded
into a **suite of tools** for testing not only prices but also shipping
rates, discounts, subscriptions, and even on-site content -- essentially
"a tool to run split tests on anything dollars and cents" related to an
e-commerce store. The company's mission is simple: **help online brands
make more money by using data** to manage pricing and profitability more
effectively. This mission reflects one of Drew's core values --
**empowering smaller businesses with capabilities that were once the
domain of tech behemoths**. Intelligems has already run over 1,000 price
experiments (across \$600M+ in transactions) and unlocked more than
\$30M in extra profit for merchants, illustrating how Drew's vision of
data-driven profit growth is being realized in practice.

## Data-Driven and Experimental Mindset

One of the clearest themes in Drew Marconi's public commentary is his
**belief in data-driven decision-making and continuous
experimentation**. He often stresses the need to replace intuition or
"finger-in-the-wind" guesses with empirical
testing[\[1\]](https://cogsy.com/podcast/intelligem-drew-marconi/#:~:text=Intelligems%20makes%20integrating%20and%20launching,companies%20like%20Amazon%20and%20Uber).
For example, in a podcast interview he argued that brands **"can't sit
and wait and see for a year anymore"** when it comes to pricing
decisions. Instead, *"testing around prices helps you make the most of
your time, and figure out \[the optimal price\] before it's too late"*.
This encapsulates Drew's bias for action -- he favors quick, iterative
experiments over long-term speculative planning.

At Intelligems, Drew has helped cultivate a **"culture of testing and
iteration"** both for his team and for the platform's users. He often
draws a parallel between pricing and other marketing tactics: just as
you continuously refresh ad creative to avoid fatigue, you should
continually test and refine your product pricing. In a company blog
post, he noted that many merchants hope to find a single "right price"
and then stick with it, but **this mindset makes him
*"uncomfortable"***[\[2\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/debunking-the-myth-of-the-perfect-price#:~:text=At%C2%A0Intelligems%2C%20we%20often%20hear%20our,next%20week%2C%20or%20next%20month).
*"While we are able to find the 'right' price for the moment, it may
change completely next week or next month,"* Drew writes, warning
against a set-and-forget
approach[\[3\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/debunking-the-myth-of-the-perfect-price#:~:text=At%C2%A0Intelligems%2C%20we%20often%20hear%20our,next%20week%2C%20or%20next%20month)[\[4\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/debunking-the-myth-of-the-perfect-price#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20same%20with%20pricing,other%20parts%20of%20the%20business).
He argues that **pricing shouldn't be a static element of the business**
-- it must be a *"constantly evolving component"* that you revisit and
adapt over
time[\[4\]](https://www.intelligems.io/resources/blog/debunking-the-myth-of-the-perfect-price#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20the%20same%20with%20pricing,other%20parts%20of%20the%20business).
In short, **continuous experimentation is central to how Drew thinks**.
When confronted with any significant decision -- whether it's a new
product idea, a UX change, or a go-to-market strategy -- he is likely to
ask: *"How can we test it?"* and *"What does the data say?"* before
fully committing.

This experimental mindset also means Drew encourages forming hypotheses
and validating them. *"You should come with a hypothesis and... try to
make it as easy as possible to run tests and understand what happened,"*
he advised in one discussion. This indicates that if a Product Manager
brings a new idea or initiative, Drew will expect a clear hypothesis or
rationale and a plan to measure results. He champions a
**test-learn-optimize loop** as the path to improvement, rather than
assuming we know the answers upfront.

## Focus on Profitability and Sustainable Growth

Another cornerstone of Drew Marconi's philosophy is a **laser focus on
profitability, margins, and sustainable growth** for both Intelligems
and its customers. Having led finance and ops teams in the past, he
frequently emphasizes that **profitability -- not vanity metrics -- is
what brands should be prioritizing**. *"I think most brands should be
focused on profitability and margin as those key metrics,"* he has
stated plainly. This perspective permeates Intelligems' product design
(which optimizes for profit lift, not just conversion lift) and comes
through in Drew's advice to merchants.

For instance, Drew often warns merchants not to chase revenue or
conversion upticks at the expense of margin. In an e-commerce podcast,
he discussed how brands can **"fight inflation"** and rising costs by
being vigilant about margins: *"Keep an eye on your margins. \...Look at
the entire bridge from gross sales down to net revenue and how costs are
changing. If margins have eroded to a point, you need to react
quickly"*. He recommends setting concrete guardrails -- e.g. knowing
that *"if we're dropping below 55% gross margin, we gotta raise prices"*
even if it might slow top-line growth. Drew's stance is that
**sustainable unit economics come first**. He is willing to make tough
calls (like raising prices or cutting discounts) to ensure the business
remains healthy in the long run. This suggests that as a leader he
values **long-term sustainability over short-term gains**.

Moreover, Drew's focus on profitability goes hand-in-hand with making
the most of what a business already has. He talks about **"maximizing
the yield"** from existing customers and traffic. Rather than simply
pouring more money into customer acquisition, he urges brands to
optimize Average Order Value (AOV), repeat purchase rates, and other
profitability levers. This mentality -- *"make more with what you have"*
-- is reflected in how he might evaluate new ideas. If a proposed
initiative can improve margins, increase customer lifetime value, or
otherwise drive profitable growth, Drew is likely to be enthusiastic.
Conversely, if an idea only drives vanity metrics (like clicks or social
buzz) without a clear path to profit, he may be skeptical. He is
constantly asking: **"How does this impact our bottom line? Are we
leaving money on the table?"** and **"Will this make the business
fundamentally stronger?"**

## Continuous Adaptation and Innovation

Drew Marconi has shown himself to be **highly adaptable and open to
change** -- both in charting Intelligems' strategy and in his personal
outlook on business. A telling example is the **origin of Intelligems
itself**. Drew and his co-founder Adam initially considered applying
their pricing expertise to mobile gaming (dynamic pricing for in-app
purchases), even getting into Techstars with that pitch. However,
**within weeks they pivoted** to focus on e-commerce, once they realized
the gaming idea wasn't gaining traction and didn't align with their
passions. Drew candidly admitted that while he enjoys video games, the
prospect of spending years optimizing in-app purchase pricing felt
*"somewhat casino-ish"*, and not something he cared to devote a decade
to. By contrast, helping a fledgling direct-to-consumer brand succeed by
selling a genuinely useful product felt far more meaningful: *"Very
different feeling in e-commerce... you're trying to bring \[a new
product\] into the world and we can help make that happen."*. This pivot
illustrates **Drew's willingness to change course when data or
conviction shows a better path**. He doesn't cling stubbornly to a plan
for its own sake; he'll iterate on the business itself to ensure they
are working on problems that matter and where they can win. As a PM, you
can expect him to be receptive to bold changes in direction **if** they
are well-founded -- he values logic and impact over comfort with the
status quo.

Within Intelligems, Drew also drives a culture of innovation and
**expanding the solution space**. Starting with price A/B testing as the
core offering, he soon recognized merchants had other profit levers that
could benefit from testing. Under his guidance, Intelligems added tools
for **shipping rate testing, discount experimentation, bundling, content
testing**, and more. Drew often describes Intelligems not just as a
single product but as an evolving **"suite"** or toolkit for profit
optimization. He is continually looking for the next area where
data-driven experimentation can unlock value -- an indicator of his
**forward-looking vision**. For example, if a PM suggests a new feature
(say, testing subscription pricing or loyalty rewards), Drew's
inclination will be to consider how it fits into this larger goal of
maximizing merchants' profitability. Is it a **new frontier for
optimization**? Does it leverage their core strength (A/B testing
infrastructure and analytics)? If yes, he's likely to support exploring
it.

Importantly, Drew's adaptability also shows up in how Intelligems
responds to market conditions. When external factors shift -- be it a
sudden change in iOS privacy affecting ad costs, or economic swings --
he looks to **innovate and adjust** rather than sticking to a rigid
plan. For instance, during periods of high inflation or new import
tariffs, Drew has spoken about creative pricing tactics (like strategic
price adjustments or surcharge testing) to maintain margins. This
reflects a **pragmatic, change-embracing attitude**: expect him to
challenge the team with questions like *"How do we turn this new
situation into an opportunity?"* and *"What can we tweak or test now to
respond?"*

## Customer-Centric and Educational Approach

Though Drew is deeply analytical, he also demonstrates a **strong
customer-centric streak** in his public comments. He frequently puts
himself in the merchant's shoes and acknowledges the psychological or
educational barriers they face. For example, he notes that many
e-commerce operators have never thought about price testing or fear how
customers might react to it. Instead of dismissing these concerns, Drew
addresses them head-on. He believes part of Intelligems' job is **market
education** -- giving merchants confidence and knowledge to embrace
data-driven pricing. *"There were really all sorts of questions thrown
our way,"* he says, ranging from *"Will my customers notice \[different
prices\]?"* to *"How do I keep groups consistent over time?"*. Rather
than seeing this as mere sales friction, Drew treats it as a **learning
opportunity** for both the company and its users.

In practice, Drew's team has created methodologies, documentation, and
even personal guidance to help customers succeed in testing. He mentions
developing best-practice "recipes," writing blog posts to **"dispel
myths,"** and holding merchants' hands through pilot tests. This shows
that **Drew values clear communication and customer empowerment**. He
wants Intelligems' clients not just to use the tool, but to understand
*why* and *how* to use it effectively. This aligns with a broader value
of his: **empowering others through knowledge**.

Drew exhibits a similar philosophy of empowerment internally and in
advice to other operators. He has suggested that companies should
**enable their teams to experiment** and make decisions, rather than
centralizing all decisions at the top. For instance, he noted that
giving a merchandising or marketing team *"permission to play with
pricing"* can unlock growth -- as long as the team also keeps the
customer experience in mind (e.g. informing customer support about tests
so they can honor any pricing discrepancies). This indicates that
**trust and accountability** are key values for him: he trusts teams to
innovate, but also expects them to be conscientious about customer
happiness. As a leader, Drew seems to strike a balance between pushing
for optimization and maintaining customer goodwill. He even highlights
that certain pricing changes can be turned into a positive customer
communication. *"Tell your customers that you are lowering your
prices... that's a great occasion to talk to your customers,"* he says
-- underscoring his belief in **transparency and customer-centric
marketing** when changes are made.

Overall, Drew comes across as **approachable and empathetic**. On social
media (Twitter/X and LinkedIn), he often shares tips, case studies, and
even quick video demos of new features, speaking in an enthusiastic but
helpful tone. He celebrates merchants' wins (tweeting out successful
test results or congratulating brands on improved margins) and invites
feedback openly. This public behavior suggests that if you, as a PM,
bring him an idea, he will listen with an open mind -- especially if
it's framed in terms of solving a customer pain point or advancing
merchant outcomes. He is likely to respond with curiosity ("How would
this help our customers? What evidence do we have?") and, true to form,
a suggestion of testing it out in a low-risk way to gather feedback and
data.

## Leadership Style and Likely Response to New Initiatives

From the above, we can infer several aspects of **Drew Marconi's
leadership style**: it's data-informed, collaborative, and
mission-focused. He operates much like a product strategist with a
testing mindset. When a new initiative is proposed, Drew will **evaluate
it against Intelligems' core mission** (does it help e-commerce
businesses become more profitable or smarter?) and against empirical
justification (do we have data or a hypothesis to back this?). He has
explicitly said that teams should start with a hypothesis and then use
tools to test and learn -- a principle he no doubt applies in internal
decision-making. So, if you propose an idea to Drew, anticipate
questions like: *"What hypothesis are we trying to prove?"*, *"How will
we measure success?"*, and *"Can we run a pilot or A/B test?"*.

Drew's track record also shows he values **speed to insight**. Early in
Intelligems' journey, instead of building a perfect product in a vacuum,
he and his co-founder onboarded a small beta group of merchants and
rapidly built out features in response to their needs. This "build with
your customers" approach highlights Drew's **lean, iterative approach**
to product development. He prefers quick iteration and real-world
feedback over lengthy theoretical debates. As a result, if you bring him
a bold idea (say a new feature or a process change), he might respond by
green-lighting a small-scale test or a time-boxed trial rather than
either rejecting it outright or accepting it unconditionally. **Expect
him to say something like, "Let's test it with one or two customers and
see what happens,"** rather than a simple yes or no. He's not afraid of
new ideas, but he wants them to prove themselves out.

Another facet of his leadership is **alignment with values and
purpose**. The way he pivoted away from a less meaningful business idea
to one that *"helps bring \[good products\] into the world"* shows that
he cares about the *why* behind initiatives. He's likely to be most
excited about ideas that align with Intelligems' value prop (e.g.
leveling the playing field for independent merchants) and his personal
values (e.g. ethical, win-win outcomes). If an initiative doesn't
resonate on those levels, he might challenge its importance. For
example, a growth hack that earns Intelligems a quick buck but doesn't
actually help customers profit might be questioned. Conversely, a
project that helps merchants succeed -- even if it's not immediately
lucrative for Intelligems -- could earn his support because it aligns
with the long-term mission of building trust and delivering value.

In terms of day-to-day interactions, Drew seems to maintain a
**down-to-earth and analytical demeanor**. He combines enthusiasm for
results with a calm, logical approach to problem-solving. Publicly, he
often cites figures and specific results (like percentage profit lifts,
number of tests run, etc.), indicating he's metrics-oriented. But he
also celebrates stories (e.g. citing a favorite example where lowering a
price significantly increased demand for a client, or how a certain
brand found its "sweet spot" using Intelligems). This mix suggests that
in meetings he will appreciate both **quantitative analysis and
real-user anecdotes**. As a PM, you might find him receptive if you
bring both data and narrative -- e.g., "Here's the data from our
experiment *and* here's a customer quote about it." That would speak to
both sides of how he thinks.

Finally, it's worth noting that Drew has a **forward-looking vision**
for Intelligems that can guide what initiatives he prioritizes. He sees
the future of Intelligems as **continuously broadening the ways it can
optimize merchants' profitability**. *"Today, we're like a profit
optimization tool... a suite of tools to run split tests on all things
dollars and cents on your site,"* he explained, hinting at plans to keep
adding capabilities. He is also aware of the broader commerce trends --
from the need for dynamic pricing in an inflationary environment to the
impact of privacy changes on marketing. Thus, an initiative that
positions Intelligems for the future (for example, **a feature that uses
machine learning to automate pricing, or an integration that addresses a
new platform trend**) would likely pique his interest. He often talks
about being reactive *and* proactive: reacting quickly to data/macro
changes, but also proactively seeking the next advantage. If your idea
fits that mold of keeping Intelligems ahead of the curve, Drew would
probably be eager to explore it.

## Conclusion

In summary, **Drew Marconi's thinking is characterized by analytical
rigor, a passion for testing, and a commitment to helping merchants
succeed**. He values **data over gut feel**, **profitability over vanity
metrics**, and **continuous improvement over complacency**. His public
statements show a leader who is not only technically and financially
savvy but also grounded in customer empathy and ethical considerations.
As a new PM at Intelligems, aligning your approach with these values
will help you gain his confidence. This means being prepared with
data-driven arguments, proposing experiments to validate big ideas,
focusing on how features will improve customers' bottom lines, and
keeping the discussion centered on learning and iteration. Drew is
likely to respond positively to ideas that are bold yet backed by
reasoning, and to team members who demonstrate a **test-and-learn
mentality**. By understanding his mindset -- **pragmatic, inquisitive,
and mission-oriented** -- you can better anticipate his questions and
collaborate effectively to drive Intelligems forward.
