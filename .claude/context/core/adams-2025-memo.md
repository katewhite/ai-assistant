# Adamâ€™s 2025 Memo

The last 18 months have been incredible. Our team has tripled, our customers and revenue roughly 10x. Weâ€™re entering a new phase of the company, and the holiday break has given me some much needed time for reflection. There are lessons to be learned from the last several years that will help propel us in 2025. In addition, there are new paradigms we need to account for, like the tremendous scale of our install base, the volume of data flowing, and the growth of our team. Here are some of my reflections as I look forward to the opportunities and challenges of 2025

## Product Innovation vs Enhancements

Over the last 4 years building Intelligems, pivoting and taking bets has felt par for the course. Making an investment in Content Testing in June 2023, knowing Google Optimize was going away, didnâ€™t feel particularly high stakes. Same was true for Volume Discounts (which later became Campaigns which later became Personalizations). These were bets we decided to make â€” if they work out great, if not then thatâ€™s OK too.

Another important call-out â€” neither content testing nor personalizations were features our customers were asking for. They were opportunities we identified based on our understanding of ways we believed our customers could leverage our technology. Letâ€™s call these investments â€œ**innovation**â€ - weâ€™re creating something new that comes from our own beliefs. Innovation is a bet that may or may not work out.

Contradict innovations with features our customers are asking for. Letâ€™s call those â€œ**enhancements**â€. These would be something like a theme test or template test â€” our customers say, *Hey wouldnâ€™t it be great if I could just A/B test two themes against each other?* And we quickly build and ship that feature. Thereâ€™s a lot less uncertainty here and a very clear justification.

For the first 2.5 years of the company (Jan â€˜21 - June â€˜23), we lived in vibrant a world of innovation and enhancements. Nobody had ever really done price or shipping testing nor tested/optimized their discounts. And while people had done content testing, it was a bet that we could go fill that hole better than anyone else. By definition, we were doing something nobody had been done before â€” we were innovating.

And for these innovations to work, we had to be incredibly customer-centric. With every new customer came a new challenge (a new upsell app, subscriptions, headless, â€¦). Even the idea to use Checkout Scripts instead of duplicate products was a customer (Shinesty) who refused to use Intelligems unless we used checkout scripts. So while the â€œwhatâ€ we were trying to do was innovative, the â€œhowâ€ it worked was all incredibly reactive to our customer needs. I attribute a huge portion of our growth to that customer centricity. Our first company values are â€œBe Helpfulâ€ and â€œPut the Customer Firstâ€ and think we embodied them early on as well as today.

Since June â€˜23, our customer base has grown from ~125 to ~1,350; our MRR from 60K to 440K; and our team from 10 to 30. This period has been a whirlwind of growth, fueled both by price & shipping testing, but also by the new â€œinnovationâ€ of content testing. (Oh, and by the way, spending a huge chunk of time and energy successfully fundraising for about 6 months during those 18.) Our hiring didnâ€™t remotely keep up with the customer growth in the beginning of 2024 to the point we were nearly profitable, a benchmark that early-stage startups typically do not flirt with. I also didnâ€™t assuredly have confidence we had found product-market-fit before 2024, so hiring like crazy felt irresponsible. And in a tough funding environment, feeling â€˜in controlâ€™ from a burn perspective was really important to us.

So itâ€™s no surprise that, largely due to capacity constraints, I feel like our progress in the last 18 months have been largely driven by enhancements and not innovation. Some of the most meaningful changes to the product in this period of time include:

- tremendous enhancements to content testing (from URL redirects to Theme tests)
- enhancements to audiences (common, custom & advanced; mutual exclusion; custom assignment)
- personalizations (a major upgrade from campaigns)
- revamp of experiments and analytics.

I donâ€™t want to belittle these enhancements, they have been *tremendously* successful and helpful to get to where we are now. In fact, I believe there are way more enhancements needed â€” like product onboarding, onsite edits, setup and configurations, our UI and design patterns, â€¦. But itâ€™s also important that we donâ€™t lose our sense of innovation in 2025.

## Vision: Product Growth Platform

The first obvious question is: *OK, so what should we go innovate?* Iâ€™ve actually been asking myself this question for a few months only to feel uninspired and disappointed with my own creativity. I think a better place to start actually is the question: *What is Intelligems and what do we want it to be?* 

Until now, weâ€™ve called ourselves â€œProfit Optimizationâ€, but quite honestly I never use those words when speaking to people. Kim called me out that, and her point rang true â€” all of our language is around *testing*. *What do you want to test? Have you tested your prices? Create your first test. Test, test, test, testing, test.* Very little of our actual product language is around profit optimization. So of course people think of us as a testing platform and weâ€™ve been sucked into the CRO testing conversation. Kimâ€™s fresh perspective is that she thought of us as a â€œgrowth platformâ€, because everybody wants to *grow* and we have or are building the tools for it. While this felt more tangible, specific, relevant, and aspirational, it also felt dated, used, tired. 10 years ago I used products marketed as â€œgrowth platformsâ€ and I feel like weâ€™re so much more than that. So where weâ€™ve landed, which currently feels more inspiring than any other alternative, is **Profit Growth Platform**.

There are a few reasons why Profit Growth Platform rings the right chords for me. 

1. â€œProfitâ€ (and broadly speaking the micro-economics of running a business) is at the core of our DNA. Unlike the traditional growth platforms, weâ€™re not trying to grow numbers of accounts, MAU, or even revenue. Weâ€™re trying to help grow profit. 
2. The term â€œgrowthâ€ already exists as a category and has best practices. Among those are things like experimentation, advanced user targeting, personalized experiences, and the like. While â€œprofit optimizationâ€ felt so ambiguous and unclear, I feel like â€œprofit growthâ€ should solicit the right types of assumptions about how we work. 
3. I love the concept of being a â€œplatformâ€. To me this means not just an amalgamation of tools to achieve a goal, but means being the source of truth â€” the core â€” that other tools and products plug in and out of for all things related to profit growth. 
4. Thinking about â€˜growingâ€™ profits is much more relatable than â€˜optimizingâ€™ them. As Jerry [pointed out](https://intelligems-io.slack.com/archives/C07K0CG9EKD/p1733525721563059?thread_ts=1733518955.638019&cid=C07K0CG9EKD), we use Profit-Per-Visitor (PPV) in our analysis because for an A/B test that doesnâ€™t have perfectly split traffic, normalizing for the number of visitors is necessary to identify the winner. Yet most merchants donâ€™t think about their business in the terms of profit per visitor, they think about it in terms of dollars and raw profits. So orienting people about growing the profit in dollars is a lot more relatable and accessible to our customers than optimizing PPV. 

## Intelligems in 2025

Going back to the question now of *What should we go innovate?* feels more approachable. To me **anything that can help our customers grow their profit** is on the table. Whether itâ€™s a bundle builder that boosts AOV, an integration with Klaviyo to achieve higher growth from your email list, or an analytics dashboard that helps you identify trends in profitability, any of these features fit squarely in the Profit Growth Platform play. Of course, we should evaluate each of these on technical ease and feasibility, estimated impact for our customers, differentiation in market, and other factors. This is not an easy exercise, but certainly one I think we are well equipped to do. 

In addition, now is the time to grow our team. When it comes to executing on this goal of striking the balance between innovation and enhancement, we need more people. We have only 4 engineers and until just recently only 1 product & design resource. Yet product & engineering has the longest lead time from ideation to impact. Until a month ago have had *zero* dedicated marketing resources while our peers have several. Our merchant success team is a fraction of what it could and should be. 

So with the Series A money fresh in the bank and the signals of product-market-fit firing, I see this as a ripe moment. We have a huge opportunity to place some bets on ourselves and our ability to build valuable products for our customers and hope they start paying off in 2025 and beyond. 

The outcomes to placing these bets are not guaranteed. Weâ€™ll need a combination of excellent execution as well as favorable market dynamics (or maybe just a little luck) for us to hit our goals. If we continue to grow 2-3x per year, in 3 years we could have the opportunity to be one of the biggest e-commerce software companies in the world. Some of the most important execution challenges I see at this point are:

- Hiring excellent talent and keeping the bar for performance extraordinary
- Balancing both product innovation with product enhancements
- Operating our remote team at a new level of scale while maintaining coordination and alignment
- Placing the right product bets at the right time
- Making our product simple, intuitive, and usable by the masses

So let's recognize that the opportunity to go build the Profit Growth Platform for e-commerce merchants is massive, and the challenges are solvable. Let's fucking go.
