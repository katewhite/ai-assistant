Me: I would say it actually started by wanting to build together, and
then the question was what to build. So there were a lot of withdraw.
Drew and I had a lot of conversations over here. What should we do? I
think there was a bit of camera seeking now. And the hammer that we had.
Was like a very deep. Appreciation and value for. Data in business
making decisions. So a B testing is a good one. Built our own AP testing
platform in the company. We also. Why did you do that? If I had known to
optimize the existed, I probably would. You got an optimizing quote?
Yeah. I mean, we got an optimizing quote after we already planned to
start an EB testing company because we were curious. What? I didn\'t
even know it existed. No, we got none on the go, King. Okay? I didn\'t
know about that. But why didn\'t we build an absent tool? Because.
That\'s a good point. We had a lot of tough decisions to make. We let
that had a lot of different stakeholders and opinions and needed to sort
of manage those opinions with data. And real quick, the other hammer
that we had in Vision A B testing was being really focused on. The
economic growth levers. Of business, whether it was top line and bottom
line, and we were partly venture backed. Business that valued growth,
but also in very tough funding environment. So value efficiency. And so
had to. Balance both of those. And knew that the tools that we were
building. Were more advanced. In the space that we were in, specifically
rod sharing and dynamic pricing and casting, than probably in most other
industries. Okay? Hannah. So let me just say that. The reason. Okay,
well, this is less my moment, but I would say, why did we build. Maybe
this platform. The first thing was like, hey, go figure out how would
you price. Across an infinite substitute was the problem that we
recommend. No two rides are the same. You know, anytime a day, different
driver payment amounts, different discount levels, people in different
part of the life cycle. Is like we need to be more profitable, and we
can\'t hurt. Gross, dad. Ken, blush can\'t hurt growth. You need to
approach that. With systems thinking you cannot finger in the microwave.
Any phenomena use we very quickly realize that we can come at it first
principles but we need to pathways mining a CEO. Hey, there\'s probably
two 26 year olds are deciding this. You need to tell. And we need an.
Obviously, we should test these things. The company knows about AB
testing, we should figure it out. I may be remembering wrong, but we
looked into could we use optimizedly. It was like, 40 grand. And that
was kind of a no go from a level of investment perspective. We also were
pretty confident. We used this other AB testing system. We were building
this pricing system from the granite up would have been more work to try
to integrate an existing framework into what we were trying to do. Bake
it. And then we never really built the testing system. It was like, add
this at this endless service. I don\'t even remember. You said it would
be more work to integrate existing framework rather than bacon it. Build
it ourselves, okay? Exactly how we wanted to. Price. A B test needs to
look at profitability number, which we would have needed to instrument
optimizedly to have all of our custom metrics in there. Not feasible.
And then that became our methodology for how we then ran. If that was
your the first 18 months and the second 18 months were like, how do we
build consistent processes that scale across cities, scale across teams,
where they can then use all these tools? Like, optimize the pricing in
that city. All right. Now, I want to add one more thing, which is E
Commerce. Like, why did we land there? I think the original thesis.
Which we were testing out in different markets, but held best in e
commerce wise. You have. Entrepreneurs and crafts people who care very
much about the art and the craft of their product, but aren\'t
necessarily the economic. Data savvy. Like skills to monetize and grow
that product. And it was an augmentation of. The excellence was. This
was a new excellence for this industry. And it was a big market. What
other issues do you look at? We looked at ride sharing, not much ankles.
We look at car rentals, we would definitely tell. We looked at most
serious flights. We talked to your jet blue friend. Most seriously. Most
serious was moving. Hotels. Restaurant upsells. Yeah, hotels. We look at
the restaurants and food delivery. Well, I think that was most SaaS.
Yeah. And why again the Jewish commerce inside of all those just start.
It wasn\'t just ark, it was actually gaming to start. But the thesis was
wrong in gaming because game developers were experts in data and
monetization. So they already had this competency. And was e commerce.
That was also a large market that did not have this competency. Okay? I
would say what we were looking for. You were very dynamic pricing focus.
There\'s also relatively small ticket purchases. Because those are going
to be faster decisions. Easier, which is easier to test. And more volume
of purchases. So like dwarf data signal. Another reason we started with
gaming was lock in user base makes it way easier to dynamically price.
Don\'t have that with E commerce. We could get the same whole different
prices back then. I also think. Sorry, go ahead. One thing that made E.
Commerce appealing as we got into it was major appetite for people. So
many people we interviewed were like, I know that I\'m bad at pricing,
and I do not stay away out of it. I don\'t know how to solve it. And
people. Were also incredibly open to share their data. Ask for help.
Versus Team Wing was, like, completely insular. I do not want to talk to
you on the phone. I think my hotels and other forms of hospitality are
also interesting. But Tiger stated, probably we spoke to someone and
it\'s like, yeah, basically army of business school grads managing Excel
spreadsheets to do pricing for each with health, location. Okay? That\'s
suboptimal. But I think that it\'s. All my consolidation in a lot of. We
didn\'t want to go like something where we get to sell to 50 customers,
and that was the total world. We wanted preferred SMB, where we could
get the private people\'s hands, develop the methodology and get the
effect of it. Maybe we\'re skipping with our mission. But. Which data
enters and ends up being the case with gaming, it was like if you\'re
small. And one of the long tail. You don\'t give a shit about
monetization. Just here on ass. There\'s only, like, eight dozen
companies big enough that they care about compensation. And did not
want. To do enterprise sales for the first two years. Okay, cool. So
much goodness in here. Let me before I say anything. Any last names at
for now. We\'ll ask more questions. Which is. To add to one what has
been said. Okay? Any observations or surprises. Literally nothing you
can do. Everything that was said already. The general. I thought the one
observation that I had which is really interesting is there\'s just been
this very consistent through line. Like, from the earliest days. Like,
the first two things and only two things I wrote down were like, maybe
the first things that were said, which is like managing a field of data
and something along the lines of decision confidence, having confidence
in decisions, which was like something that YouTube experienced and were
solving for. When I find fascinating about that. Is that. That\'s quite
literally every day what we\'re talking about. Like the market meeting
from us. Right. Like managing opinions with data and decision
confidence. And there\'s just been this for years. There\'s constant
through one. Cool consistency. Great. Okay. One thing I would add. I
don\'t know. When this came in, we did like the idea, and it sounds
good. We\'re democratizing, like, oh, shit. It took us so much time and
smart people\'s effort and people to build a system that we still
thought was. Rescue. And We were pretty we were anti Amazon very early.
Like What do you mean by anti Amazon? Like, super early on, it was clear
that, like, we shouldn\'t build this for Amazon, and Amazon was
actually, like the bogeyman in some ways of, like, Amazon is, like,
price testing you and making Amazon face it. And we will, like help you
compete Okay. Why did you sign that ad content testing? Painful reasons.
We got asked about it. A ton. Like, as soon from the moment we started
testing things people price tests began, well, if I change the price and
my free shipping threshold need to change, which then begat oh, my free
shipping threshold changed. Now I need to change my life volume
discount. Level. Which also begat, like, oh, I\'m so curious. Could I
just change the way I talk about price? And like, that would create the
impact So the moment that you start getting cancer, answers to people
that provide clarity on business, you would get that more. Questions.
And our approach was like, yeah. I would say very early. It was, like,
this should be more than just pricing. Pricing is really hard, and,
like, just one piece of the equation. That was for Andrew. You were,
like, first person. Here. So you should go next. Then BlueOptimize went
away, which accelerated the amount of question. That were coming to us.
We had actually, like, a large part of the tech underpinning done. Price
testing was over larger was a harder problem that went deeper, and it
was actually And yeah, it felt like a a bet worth taking. To. Expand our
reach and, like, expand with the perfect that people can test. And so I
think it\'s bracket rate Yeah. This? I mean, I think they were, even,
like, other examples signals. Branch is one of our first like the
chairs. And the when we ran a price test for them, and then the second
thing we wanted to run was in the image peak. And we were, like can\'t
do that. With shipping testing, came, like, updates to the banner. Like,
everyone\'s banner said, free shipping over access. So, like, in the
products And the products bar. So we had to build ability to change text
throughout your site. Content. Throughout your site. Already. So we we
had built the content testing functionality But didn\'t was more of a
positioning question So we actually built content testing. We didn\'t
position it because of and we\'re like seems silly to compete with the
free Google tool. And maybe even in hindsight, you could have competed
with a free Google tool. But at that point, it felt I think we send
people everywhere, like, don\'t pay us. Yeah. It\'s like, we\'re too
expensive. Yeah. We were much cheaper. Than we are today. But So we said
don\'t like, we\'re not gonna compete with the food. Tool. But even
though, like, presumably, we already have built a lot of functionality.
Before we even said we had it. K? Wait. And and No. Yeah. Agrees. Low
very low baronetrient. You actually I think you didn\'t mention the the
part that was mean, the whole infrastructure around playing the role in
disaster tracking data, all of it, like, it shares 90% of the stuff
price testing. So it was really easy to add at least a, like, a bare
bones version of it. And then and then Google optimized one of my items,
like, why don\'t we meet the the cost for us was dot training us was
really So cash will be on the track. Okay. Who was the first customer
that you felt like you made difference for? Shines. Okay. Tell me that
experience. I mean, I I I have a lot. I mean, ShineSue is our first
customer with any sort of mean volume. Like, they seemed huge. They are
big, they were also willing to take out a leap on us and and and kinda
co develop the product together. And so, like, the integration took,
like, six weeks I was like, in their repo. I basically, like, was on the
phone with the developer all day, every to try and, like, make this all
work. And so it took, like, months to get this live. I remember the
first night it went live. And, like, I was taking my dog for a walk, and
I loaded the dashboard. On my phone. And it was just like it\'s, like,
it was so obvious that, like, every single dollar increase was causing
slightly lower conversion. It\'s just like I can\'t believe it\'s
talking more And it was just like it was really obvious there was
working. Like conversion is going down for the people who we said had a
higher price, which meant that they presumably were seeing the higher
price and then also responding to So, like, not only was it, like, the
mechanics were all working, but, like, it was having an effect on
whether or not people decided to buy a new pair. Lasers that day. And so
I was like, was like for me. Just like a pop. I don\'t know. I mean,
Rasa, our first customer, Like stood up to me, and then you know,
checking the dashboard. Business has Anywhere. Last five years, but we
told them that, like, they raise prices, and they that\'s big basically
been the problem with their business. Business. So I know if we we end
up finding a solve, but we told him the truth. Okay. Who is the customer
you wish you could help her serve? And why? Nike. K. Let me raise that.
There\'s two. He Straight brand Target app to buy things. I get
personalized offers all the time. For, like, 80 stuff. So I\'m not I\'m
not I\'m But Okay. Last question, I think. How will you know when you
made it? Personally or intelligents? It\'s an expectation that people
expect as as I like, I I was gonna kinda figure it around pricing, but
more than just pricing. Has that been a bit of experience of pricing
when you go to target.com as when people order Uber. Like, buying soap
is not that different than buying gas. Is not that different than
ordering Uber. And, like, it\'s just, like, it it\'s as efficient as a
market as poss When it\'s when I can go to a conference and, like about
ecommerce and there are 50% of the talks, like, intelligence just has
astray about some who\'s used the same way that, like, Clay Neo is
ubiquitous. Or, like, Shopify is it\'s just, like, the obvious. Like,
it\'s I don\'t know what our verb would be, but, like, it\'s verbs in
the way that Google or Kleenex is. Yeah, like, this is just odd.
Obviously what used to run the business. Okay. Work. Yeah. Objection.
Jet. Jet. Jet. I personally think that there is both a mission and
vision in this. Do you all feel that way? Yes. I\'m gonna send that.
What\'s interesting, the drift. Like, I wrote down just point of
noticing What resonated more with me was talking about, like, helping
sort of that that person who\'s really good at their product, like, at,
like, the craft of their product. And then we really step pretty far
away of that when we\'re, like, actually, we\'re about making markets
efficient, and we are helping target. Right? So the part that resonated
with me is, like, as an employee was actually more about the
democratizing You know? But I I do see, like, obviously, we have to go
do all those things to be huge, but, like, where\'s where\'s the value?
Mhmm. Like, where\'s the value to the end customer? Like, describing
something in more human terms. Like, what does it mean to match, like,
the right audience to the right experience? Like, that kind of thing.
Like that\'s where it starts to get interesting. Like, I remember one
time you said something in one of your onboarding sessions, and, like,
it really resonated with Siver when he was, like, yeah. The way Drew
described it was, like, great because it was about, like, oh, we\'re
just you know, optimizing, like, every page on the Internet. And he was
like, that you can get behind. But it wasn\'t about, like, commerce and
markets and you know, it was more about, like, we\'re making change at
scale. Target and Nike? Because they represent, like, the pinnacle of
customer use cases and scenarios? Like, Or, like, cloud. Closer to the
source of your data. Can we get block level of data, and will that make
third immediately flows to the bottom line. Business. Like, we make an
improvement on pricing or on shipping or on this. Like, that margin is
immediately visible. It\'s not some, like, law complex. It made this
better. Made this better. It made this more efficient. Okay. Yeah. No. I
might be regretting this hard answer. Is that your first mean, the point
about democratization like like, a bit. But why that, like, Yeah. Don\'t
know. Maybe there\'s this other thought that I\'m having. Of, like I
think that\'s I think it\'s easy to think of dynamic pricing. And,
again, like, I was these are very, like, a if we about the dynamic
pricing for Uber, it\'s easy to think about how that just benefit Uber,
but it also can benefit consumer. When, like, I get a Flash Pro at 25%
off. And now it\'s, like, actually cheaper for me to get home than it
normally is. Because, like they\'re oversupplied. Yeah. And so, like, I
don\'t know. Like, I can it\'s not when I think about this, like, making
markets efficient. Markets are two sided, and it\'s not just the
companies that are our customers that we\'re serving, but it\'s also the
other. People on the other side of the market, the buyer Yeah. Who are
who are also being served. Too by more efficient market. They\'re not
that is not a. I efficient. Feels pretty different. You know what mean?
Yeah. That\'s only true if we\'re not talking us because they charge you
for prices people. You just wouldn\'t have taken that ride. Okay. But
it\'s true if you it\'s true if you help out. Like, one of our customers
we help them the panel or price. Think what you\'re saying is true. But
if we charge different prices at different people surplus is captured by
the by the producer. And then by the customer service, Well, maybe by
some customers. And I\'m saying, You could like, you can make the
argument that, like, there\'s a Robinson effect where it\'s like, I\'m
gonna charge a rich person more money, so I can subsidize it for a poor
person. Okay. But that\'s at least zero sum in that. Alright. So here\'s
what I just did. All y\'all are debating that. Bye. Where is this? I
went to my favorite tool called Yeah. And using this article from Lenny
as a framework, how we convert interview into a draft mission and vision
we can look at. You must draft these to be the framing of the future
multibillion dollar business that is identified and solved with real
problem in the world that has a lasting impact in the world. And I
basically just gave the whole thing. K? Mhmm. Here\'s what I this is the
first one. Democratize intelligence commerce. For every business. And
the vision is a world where every purchase is as dynamic personalized,
and efficient as ordering a But before we look at the other one,
observations, reactions, things you like, things you don\'t. I\'m hurt
by this, like, this I think it comes from the Target thing. This, like
it\'s me, it\'s not so much about the value. It\'s just the fact that I
think retail is very different from deep sea brands, because you are
making the price is just like, I gonna be completed. Wrong. Because
you\'re mentioned categories and the the suppliers are putting things on
promo and you\'re getting them you\'re, like, trading them off against
each other. I just think it\'s like very different And so here, that\'s
when I hear commerce and the market and retail, just feel a little I
don\'t know, something about that feels like a little bit off. Me. K.
Others? I like the word democratize, but I do feel the tension. With
that. Like, I think know can\'t build a business arming SMBs. We
specifically chose that word. I think it it I what I like about German
is, like we\'re taking something very complicated, making it accessible,
We are, like making a niche talent broadly. Usable. I like that. K? What
was the friction with the bronchitis? Oh, I I just think, like, if
you\'re serving that listen. This is kind of what I a little bit of what
was. Pointing out, but, like, we\'re not just serving mom and pops. And,
like, I think in a lot of ways I see. I see. Market. I see. I
commoditize the friction in the like Yeah. I agree with you. And I
can\'t like my own personal background, I can\'t believe I\'m person
that\'s that\'s about to say this, but I think that all the companies we
looked at before had these, like, aspirational sort of world impactful
goals. We also are in a for profit business and I think that you can do
both. You can try and do both. We\'re like, that\'s Yeah. In your
strategy over time. So I wouldn\'t overthink K? And I am rethinking too
because initially, like, I did have a reaction to, like, the moving
upmarket. But it\'s like moving upmarket gives you the optionality to
then push more power down. Yeah. And this is like the strategy while the
companies were to start at the highest value. And then try and, like,
push out to the bottom. And Yeah. Right away. That\'s what Yeah. Mean,
it\'s not a lot of a thing Yeah. Yeah. Come. Yeah. That\'s good. A
common. That feels right. Anything else for you look at the next
example? I think it\'s a lot of work. Oh, yeah. I would say, you know, I
I think I think I like the crust. But less is more after having and
trying to pronounce our current Yeah. Did she? Do you think that dynamic
pricing has to a part of the vision? The word pricing doesn\'t show up
here. Dynamic, personalized, and efficient is already gonna be renting
to me that means that there\'s dynamic pricing. The way that we
understand it. And I don\'t know that that has to be a further mission.
At this point. I\'m pushed back. I don\'t know. What about the one
beneath the dynamic and intelligence? Yeah. I guess I guess To me. To
everyone, or could it be that, like, there\'s an always on price test.
Right? It\'s like things are happening a little more slowly with also
means the the definition you? Or are we because I just I find it hard to
believe that we will ever get to a point where, like, we\'re trying to
get different of t shirts. Every Saturday. Just find that hard to do.
What if we\'re defining the world\'s best marketplace as opposed to
chasing it? Yeah. I also wait. Say that again. What if we\'re defining
the world\'s best marketplace as opposed to chasing it? It doesn\'t
exist. Like, we\'re in a position to potentially redefine what does that
mean. As opposed to anchoring on, you know, oh, we we take you know, the
learnings from the world\'s best market place and we democratize them.
It\'s more like, no. What we actually shape what that good looks like in
the marketplace. Does that make sense? It\'s, like, just sort of trying
to reach a little bigger. In town. Yeah. Yeah. We\'re not comping
ourselves. I well, I I totally understand it\'s, like, one step further.
Which is if you draw this out to its logical max I\'ll be real dramatic.
Let\'s assume that every business that sells anything online is using a
Intelligems. Bruce Lee. Well, by that virtue, using a T shirt example,
we literally know what a T shirt costs anywhere at any time. Any
dimension about it. So, like, by that center, it is the global
marketplace. The Internet is the marketplace. Yes. We are Right.
Exactly. You have you have intelligence and the ability to push the
right match for every purchase. Yeah. Are you right when you guys are
now on? Alright. Yeah. I think It\'s true. Yeah. I also think that,
like, it\'s I lean towards intentionally broad language. Here. Mhmm.
Yeah. I mean, personally, I think so. Also, gives you optionality. Like,
if we\'re Yeah. Give me one that\'s more general. I got this. The think
it\'s it\'s it\'s a little more general. It\'s not so specific about
efficiency, and it\'s more about continuous learning, knowing knowing
the right price. Yeah. I prefer to dynamically, ruthlessly, efficiently
showing the right because I don\'t believe that that actually gonna is
the thing. But I think where a merchant can know the right price all the
time, always have information, it just feels like more realistic vision.
Yep. Others? Continuously learning really resonates. Yep. Yep. And
optimizes Yeah. The two Yep. It\'s it\'s it\'s the practice that we try
to create. Mhmm. The the first half of division, like. That says the
right price, the right message, the right offer Yeah. For every
customer. Like, sounds like something I used to say I was consultant at
IBM. And it was just like, I I thought it was such a load of horseshit.
Didn\'t like it. Enough. No. No. I I I I don\'t like it. Yeah. Cool. The
right price, the right message, the right offer Yep. To every customer
Like, I I\'ve heard that You\'re right, man. I\'ve heard it. I\'ve heard
that. Literally on Silicon Valley. And it\'s, like, it\'s, like, every
ad spot. Like, everyone. Like, it\'s Yeah. Used. K. It\'s like building
a better future together. It\'s mildly. But you like the first part.
Yeah. Yeah. And I like the concept of it. I still like the. Is the
mission? I\'m just curious people thought of this. Second mission. K? I
mean, this I I have to say that, like, something about bringing
intelligence to commerce. Mhmm. I don\'t know if that\'s the mission.
But it does combine the it does bring up demon democratizing. It does it
does speak to, at least in the, like, kind of Shopify space, this idea
of, like, the people that we sell to don\'t necessarily have the tools
or the skill set But absolutely. To know how Some version of that. I\'m
not gonna say say I don\'t think that\'s it. There\'s something
interesting. About bringing out that something that always comes up me.
You guys and particular is, like, how do we distribute knowledge? I\'m
always thinking about that from a marketing standpoint. We can
distribute the knowledge in your head. Literally like, that\'s our
marketing. Strategy. Right. So just, like, make commerce smart. Yeah.
Yeah. And And And It\'s like we\'re the missing piece of commerce. Yes.
Yep. Yeah. There\'s another there\'s a framing we used early that was,
like, where the brain behind your your store. Yeah. Mhmm. You\'re like
the commerce Like, you guys use that in your Yeah. Our logo is on the
brain. Mhmm. That totally tracks. Yeah. Smart smart science. Intelligem.
The mission, power the intelligent marketplace. The vision, a world
where commerce continuously learns. Merchants build smarter, customers
find better value. Yeah. I I like it feels disingenuous. Sorry. About.
The end. Customer here. Or, like, I would wanna think hard Yeah.
Actually And then this one, I\'m like, I that the Intelligence. Not I
don\'t know that years. Something like that. Yeah. Intelligent. To every
business. But the vision is a world where every merchant continuously
learn works. I think that we\'ve gotten, like, less ambitious in trying
to like, I do think we\'re Not aspirational. Yeah. And, like, feel like
this is a theme. Yeah. No. Like, this actually feels like how we work.
Like, this Like, we start here, and then it gets like Oh, and then it\'s
like can\'t I feels hand wavy. Yep. And then it\'s, like, smaller
smaller Yep. Not that this is right or closer. Or not I think in my
effort like, be really specific. We get weird, like, dive down the
flames. Yes. The first few visionary visions. Yes. Yes. Because we were
like, oh, we don\'t want this, but we do want that. And we\'re like to
pick their apart, and now we\'re smaller than 88. Could you go back to
the first one? Yeah. Yeah. Just because it might have been the best.
Claim. Mean, I think the first admission is and what was the second fit?
For me, in the second I think the second vision is equally ambitious.
And just a little bit more general. Wait. Wait. What was the second? So
this was the first one to democratize into intelligence. Commerce for
every business. The second vision, just this. This is the one that was
sort Things we became known as the place that helps any uncertain
question in a business get easily answered tested and answered. Did you
have any did any of these guys share anything with you about what has
been surfaced in from Alex in marketing? No. Because what\'s fascinating
about what you wrote is Alex is gonna come into the room. We\'re gonna
talk about how to frame ourselves. And he\'s gonna use pretty much these
words. Confidence. Decide with confidence. What are we selling? We\'re
selling with confidence. Selling decision quality. We\'re not selling an
answer to a test. We\'re, like, literally, like, everything that he has
come back to is that it\'s just fascinating. To see you took well, none
of this showed up. But The the question of whether to go deeper
vertically or horizontal feels great. Important to me. I mean, right
now, our strategy is not at all in horizontal. Like the offers and
experiences things like that. I don\'t think fit much less into this
than they would with something that\'s more commerce focused. And so Fit
less into this. Yeah. Like, the next the next step strategically might
might be to go find another vertical or to build a more robust testing
platform or more generic rather than to build some things that are for
our customers that we have to serve today. So when I that\'s one thing
I\'m trying. I will I I will say, like, I some reasons you guys, but,
occasionally, in the success, and we talked really small customers who
just, like, schedule a call. I talked to this guy who runs a pen
company. He lived in Cedar Rapids. He\'s like, oh 60 five. And his
review was like, he was running when to like, his strategy was all over
the place. And he wanted more confidence. In his decision making.
Someone told him he needs to look at price. He downloaded Intelligems.
He did a microprocessing. And he wanted to be able to, like, answer some
questions data. Like, it what our customers are coming to us for. I do
like this. Like, I think this is what we do. I just don\'t know if this
is what sets, like, intelligence apart just from, like, why you
shouldn\'t just use AB testing software or data in your decision. In in
your like, like, I don\'t think this is about Intelligems. I think this
is about, like why you should do a test. Data in your that make sense?
Like, is special about Yeah. I guess what I\'m saying is, like, is the
ambition to be the operating system behind. Ecommerce? Or is it to be
the operating system a more generic, like, decision confidence layer,
and all this Like, those are the two different vertical resource on a
question. You could tweak this and and make it one of the other. Right?
Yeah. So before I answer the question, I let\'s look at some of these.
And ask a similar kind of question. Alright? Well, I was thinking about
this because like, Microsoft. Right? Yeah. Fine. I don\'t think we can
diminish the, like, impact that Microsoft has had on our lives. It is
not in my mind, it has I guess it depends on what inspires you, but,
like, yeah, I just find my That was that was that was crazy
aspirational. Like, that was thirty years ago. Right. Yeah. Right. That
was, like Yeah. Yeah. Crazy aspirational in the time. Yeah. It\'s like,
this is such an insensitive thing. Good. Is there, like, a, like, a
rising tide? All boats? Kind of situation here. Like, meaning, when I
saw the Microsoft one, I thought it was really interesting. Interesting.
Because, like, let\'s say thirty years ago, that that one\'s very
aspirational. And they did their job right, it wasn\'t it was just that
you believed in having a computer on your desk. That wasn\'t and and
everybody if we do our jobs right, everybody in the world will believe
in this idea of having a computer on their desk. And, hopefully, they
buy ours, but a rising tide is Yeah. They saw. And so to me, the what
you put out there feels a bit more like that. And I know that the space
of commerce in general is has, like, arrived at place of like, what
we\'re really trying to do make better decisions and decide with
confidence and, like, can get to that place. Then like, we\'re building
long term sustainable businesses Right? Which all of these commerce
companies have to think about. Doesn\'t necessarily have to tell me My I
know if issue is the right word. My felt like what you wrote Mhmm. Was a
little small. That\'s Why did you It like, base so so my reaction was
like, like, it\'s it\'s it\'s almost like the first step. So it\'s like
you test it, and you make now you feel good about your decision. But,
like, what happens when an AI bot is making is, like, coming up with the
ideas and testing it and doing it for you and it\'s optimizing for you.
And you\'re just like letting it run. And now the internet is just like
a self optimizing thing that is, like, figuring it all out. It has
nothing There\'s no, like, feeling confident about your decision or my
decision. It\'s like hey. Let\'s build a more optimal efficient dynamic
Like, that that\'s, like, one layer of beef. It. Is, like, to me. So
that was, like, what I think this is what we do today. But it\'s not,
like, don\'t see this as the end state. I like decision, and we\'ve been
we\'ve been batting around decision. I don\'t know. Was that maybe even
older when were talking about decision like My aspiration is we we\'re
not giving you the tools to measure it. We it\'s a step one. We are just
making the decisions for you. Feels like Mhmm. That\'s the brain.
That\'s we will get paid a lot more if we are doing that. This this has
poor retention. This vision. I it\'s like one hot take. Like, Greg, you
get pulled in. You can McKinsey does this. I mean, is it as simple as,
like, for you. Potentially. What did you what did what changed? But I
don\'t wanna test and inform I want to eventually do it for you. Get
paid. For it. Like, the other piece and and this maybe is is overly
small. There\'s something So specific about a purchase decision. A
consumer or a business deciding purchase something, and there\'s, like,
all of this richness that goes to the consideration. How is the product
position? How is it price, What was said about it? What data are we
collecting? Where did that person come from, and, like we lose the the
moment of purchase or the commerce element. And so that actually, like,
I liked the last mission number three maybe or it said, like, commerce
for every business was one of them. The Microsoft has got Intelligent
Commerce firms. Yeah. Commerce for every business. Like, every business
has commercial. Components. Like, that\'s the purchase. And I think we
have distinct advantage thinking about purchases what drives this.
Decisions. And I So I\'m gonna I\'m gonna pause this here. Yeah. Because
I feel like we\'re reaching okay. Point where it\'s more productive for
y\'all. To chew on this. But before we do, I\'m gonna assert an opinion
on how I would if I were with y\'all, push the discussion. Mhmm. Because
I hear you, but I don\'t agree with you. And I wanna articulate what I
feel and why I don\'t agree. Okay? Mhmm. I think when I think about
this, I think there is a dimension that is something to the effect of,
like, There\'s the punch line is I prefer no. I said prefer because it
doesn\'t mean it\'s right or wrong. It\'s it\'s entertaining. I prefer
missions and visions that are very abstract and very, very, very removed
from the specific application. And I like to take the nuance of market,
the nuance of product, the nuance of the experience put it into the the
strategy. Which is how do we win to achieve the vision as closely as
possible to as maximum fruition. K? That\'s Mike. Personal side. Okay.
So if you\'re gonna go do that, how do you think about what this vision
is in a way that allows you to inform a strategy. Which is this. I
believe if we anchor on decisions as the thing that we influence, make,
whatever, The strategy goes down into what is the world of decisions and
what is the sort of order of operations of decisions that we inform and
or make? And perhaps, the way the business goes is it\'s like the the
sort of sequence of the product experience is we first inform we then
make decisions. And so, like, we need to build tooling to help you
decide, then we gotta, like, decide it for you. Okay? So, like, consider
that, like, cheap car expensive. Car. Okay? Then basically get into,
like, well, which decisions are we gonna go after? There are some
decisions that have high cardinality. This was like cardinality is like
a number of possible permutations. So like the ride sharing one is like
a super high permutation. Permutation. Right? Low cardinality might be,
like, I don\'t know, office space or something. Right? There\'s just,
like, only so many options with so many things. To consider. High data,
probably literacy is a better word to use here. This would be, like,
target. Like, pricing for Target or Nike is like up here. Right? Yeah.
And then, like, the pen company right, might be, like, pen company.
Okay? Like, the markets can get informed this way and the types of
decisions themselves can get informed this way. Way. So if it were me I
might be losing gas. But if it were me, I would say there\'s an order of
markets that have high cardinality, low data sophistication. This might
be like e com and this might be, like, hotel rooms. So you\'d go in this
direction. Terms of what you serve. And then if you were to repaste this
like just an ecommerce in decision types on here. It might be like low
10. Yeah. It\'s Extremely high right now. Cool. And so, like, you could
put, like, content here. And maybe pricing is low cardinality, and you
don\'t need a ton of data, maybe interestingly, as you plot the
questions, like, you move this way, simpler and more complex questions,
from more options, lower data, literate, industries to others. And the
way that you go about each subsequent question and each subsequent
market is by first giving the tools to inform and then the tools to go
make. And so, like, framing it, right, when you get into the strategy
of, like, first, we do achieve car, then we do or we do expensive car
and then she turns it up. You follow a similar pattern but all along
it\'s under the auspices of making any decision. Anywhere in the world
make the right choice. Everything that you\'ve written it is related to
commerce. So I wonder if you guys decide. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But maybe
okay. I guess you were just agreeing with Drew, but then I I sort of,
like, substantiate the Well, my my opinion on this business, and I\'m
thinking on, like, a thirty year time horizon, I don\'t understand why
any business that publishes anything on a digital surface whether
that\'s on the internet or a billboard. Wouldn\'t use something like
this. To me like, that\'s frankly what Yes. Made me invest in this
company. It\'s like, sure. We have a pricing experience and I recognize
that commerce has to do that. But, like, the whole point of having a
pixelated surface is that can change it. Right? And so, like, if you
believe in the infinity of time that there\'s incremental data that can
be crunched more quickly to inform that experience, but some has to go
do that. I think it\'s gonna be it. Yeah. But that\'s okay. But towards,
like, a conversion. Like, what is the conversion? It depends on the
business. But Hi. In a sense, you\'re trying to alright. This is, like,
we\'re we\'re we I\'m listen. I love you. Showing this. We can debate
all day. Y\'all is your company. Yes. You have to decide this. It might
make sense to scope it at this level on the commerce side. That\'s fine.
I were in the company, wouldn\'t. I\'m not in the commerce. Who gives a
shit what I say? Just giving you another Yeah. I also think, like, the
decision, like, you need to, like, inform it and then make it. Is also
limiting because it\'s still the scope is not just decision. Right?
Like, you have decisions that you make all the time in business. But,
actually, part of it is also just, like, generating the pixels and
that\'s not a decision. That\'s also part of just, like, the experience
building. Like, for example, enabling a business to have is, like, a
very, very narrow thing. Enabling a business to have an in cart upsell
is not a decision. I mean, they may want they may want to have testing
to help them know that that\'s a thing, then once they know that they
should have the thing, we also wanna deliver that. That\'s not well,
actually, that\'s that\'s the power to make the decision, not the power.
Make the experience. Yeah. Yeah. So so to me, that\'s that\'s the piece.
The the, like, the the delivery is the piece that I think is missing the
decision making framework, which is like, I I think that, like, by by
zooming out from the decision to the experience Yeah. Is is where I get
stuck. And and, by the way, when you\'re talking about strategy,
technically speaking, part strategy is like why is what are y\'all gonna
win over anyone else? And starting to talk about it was complicated to
implement, optimize I need four different tools. The other things are
too expensive. These are reasons why the current market offering are not
good. And they have four principles of product you will deliver that
make you differentiated and preferred. Right? So part of the technology
discussion here is, like, this is about listening. This is about
processing. This is about posting. Following there? Which is, like,
effectively, like, API functions. Obviously, this is componentry to it.
It\'s either connector build. Separate decision. But when you start to
talk about the road map, for answering a certain question in a certain
market, this tell starts to tell you what integrations do we need. What
componentry do we need, What type of data model do we need given, you
know, the the objects that they\'re looking at? Like, it starts to tell
you above me on commerce, where do we go in the future? Which is not
answering the next six to eighteen months but it starts to suggest the
next five years. Inside. Is like let\'s not play it that safe. Like,
let\'s let\'s just like it\'s not gonna be perfect. Mhmm. And there will
be an element of disagree and commit from people. Yep. And, like, it\'s
not we\'re not gonna be able to, like, very clearly come up like,
everything is not gonna ladder up to the to the thing. Like, the people
are gonna be able to hope holes. And, like but we just need to go with
something big and aspirational that we feel good about that we also know
is not a type decision we can come back from it again. Yeah. Cool. I
don\'t I I don\'t even he knocked it out of park. But hopefully, this,
like, made us incrementally closer. Yep. Yeah. To something Yeah. So
was, like, parting, I don\'t know, homework or whatever. Everyone can
send this stream Adams. I\'d spend a little time with this again. As
you\'re thinking through. Like, we didn\'t talk about what strategy
would look like. What goals would look like, what room number would look
like. We all we can see connotations. And as a result, it\'s hard to
ladder stuff together. Spend some time with that to figure out the
relationship of these things. Obviously, you guys made the decision. But
at the end of the day, once the decision is made the team is responsible
for saying, how are gonna go do that? And what is next and why, like,
all these things, which is literally three, four, and five. Yeah. Yeah.
So it\'s very important that you understand how those things come
together. Yeah. Okay? Yeah. And if it\'s helpful to have brainstorming
sessions, venting sessions, feedback sessions, whatever along the way
for this, I volunteer as tribute. Happy to also find mother of her
voices. And hopefully, we\'ll get there pretty soon. Sweet. Think
there\'s one I really Fifteen minutes, but I gotta leave here probably
by, like, the next fifteen or twenty minutes. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. It
was great. That was great. It is helpful. I\'m just I just Yeah. Yep.
Yep. Appreciate it. One. And have a nice fifteen, twenty minutes Heat
it. He cursed Alright. I still think we\'re violently agreeing, Jake. I
I don\'t actually see to scream. Great. laid out. Commerce to me is like
stuff getting sold. Not ecommerce. As not, like, small c. Then That\'s
fine. But, like, Wikipedia is not in our I don\'t need that digital
surface. To be At the it\'s not my thing. No. No. So I have, like I\'m
I\'m trying to I have biases in, like, whatever else. I I think I I when
you get into I suppose, like, the debate comes, like, where is the line
of commerce And, like, if we believe that part of decision making has to
do with, like, the either the specifics, like verbiage over visual or
the There? Here. Here. Or There. Like, I is that
