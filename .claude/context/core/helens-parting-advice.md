Transcript:
 
Them: Hi.  
Me: Hello. How are you feeling?  
Them: I mean, if I sit perfectly still, it's totally fine.  
Me: And don't laugh and don't breathe too heavy.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, I went into the doctor, and they were like, there's really nothing to do about it, and, like, you can take a full breath, so.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Y.  
Them: And they were like, come back. And, like, in two days, if the pain doesn't get better, come back. And I'm like, All right.  
Me: Eah y. Eah. Apparently, that is. The big thing is, like, if it's so painful that you can't take a deep breath, then you have, like, pneumonia risk and all this stuff. But. Otherwise. I just remember that from when Evan did it. And it was like. Covid ish time? I think so. It was an even bigger. They were like. Make sure you can breathe.  
Them: That is helpful to breathe.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'm just, like, rolling over in bed last night. Like.  
Me: I heard it's, like, the most painful.  
Them: Yeah. I figured out how to, like, wedge myself in some pillows finally. It's so stupid because, like, Ryan is out of town. He's coming back tonight. And I was like, dude, I had just had the crap kicked out of me this week. Like, come back and, like, take the trash out.  
Me: Oh, my gosh. Seriously? I was gonna say, as if you're weak. Probably hasn't already been chaotic enough.  
Them: Yeah. No, I just, like, managed to, like, serially, like, injure myself this week, so I'm just. I don't know. I think I'm just distracted. But.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: As of now. So I think the plan on comms is just fine to discuss it. I don't think. There's, like, any kind of embargo, really. Like, Drew was just basically like, drop your posts like, Friday morning as, like, a last day post. And I was like, okay. And I know. Some. Some department leads are, like, going to tell their teams before that, like Jen is telling success before that and, like, stuff like that. They're just going to cascade it so I don't have to do any more like one on ones because I actually need to finish the work.  
Me: That's nice. Yeah.  
Them: So that would probably be helpful if I finish a work. I had, like, a tactical question for you on the PM career ladders. I had that, like, on my flesh list of, like, things I was planning on taking care of. How much do you all want to take that on and have ownership over that? Because, like, I absolutely could do it, which is, you know, like a synthesis of ones from old jobs and maybe some of the elements will. Like the one that you shared. But. I wonder if it's something that should belong to the team, like, in terms of, like, defining your own standards, because you're effectively stepping up as, like, you know, more product leadership. And, like, Craig's stepping up and Emily's stepping up, and it's like, With that.  
Me: Yeah, I mean, I'm happy to take that. With any, I guess, like research or input that you already kind of have, even if it's just a dump of stuff. That'd be good.  
Them: Yeah, I was thinking of, like, picking the competencies and then doing, like, some Claude work and maybe seeing how close I could get to the design ladder format.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But. I feel like it's. I'm. I don't want to leave something and be like this was set in stone. Like, I. I really want you all to pick it up. Make it your own, right?  
Me: Y. Ep.  
Them: I need to do, like, a baseline one just so that I can give Hannah her review. Like, she still wants me to do her review. So I'm going to do that on Friday, but. I don't know. I was like, hey, you know, should. Do you want Kate and Adam to do it instead? Like, I can write up notes, and then, you know, maybe. I don't know, but she was like, no, let's do it. So get it over with.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Cool. Anything that you're able to share in in that regard for her review, just so I'm privy to. Or I can just ask her.  
Them: You'll get a copy, you'll be fine.  
Me: Okay? Cool.  
Them: I don't think there's any reason not to. It's not like we file them anywhere, either.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it'll be like, I'll just add you on, like, a copy and the notion doc or something, just so you can give feedback, because I always do a draft and, like, I'll share that. You know, with you and with Adam. Probably, like, end of day today or first thing tomorrow. And then I'll share it with her, like, probably, like end of day tomorrow so that she can pre read it. But I always make a clean copy for the share version.  
Me: Got it. Yep. Makes sense. Okay.  
Them: That'll be like, the stakeholder version, and then. Polish version.  
Me: Perfect. All right. Sounds good. Yeah. I just kind of wanted to. Make the last, like, ditch effort at some, like, advice. And feedback and all the things. So I think, like, top of mind for me. I've always appreciated your insights into, like. And how in tune you are to like other people and how they work and what works and doesn't work in communicating with them and working with them. And so top of mind for me is like, Adam, of course, like, advice for working with Adam.  
Them: Oh, yes.  
Me: And then, even like Craig, I've just barely. Scratched the surface of working with him. Those are two. Top of mind and then maybe a little bit. Hannah don't know exactly how much interaction, even as her manager, you've had with her, but those are the three. But of course, Adam being kind of the main one.  
Them: Yeah. If you promise not to tell anyone, I will share you on my Adam Claude project. I have a synthetic atom.  
Me: I can absolutely make that promise because I. I started something similar, but I would love. Yeah.  
Them: It's in my. My personal folder. Like my personal Claude so I can share that with you. Do you have, like, a personal email to use? I think I corresponded with that when the hiring process. Is that one okay to use? So I will share to that and it is our secret and.  
Me: Y. Ay.  
Them: Horrible, but it works. What I did was like, it's. It's a little out of date. So actually, like, if you wanted to add more context to it or add it on an ongoing basis, you should totally feel free to do it. Or just grab the context that I uploaded and put it in your own or, like, whatever you want. To do is fun, but it's like, a bunch of intelligence episodes, a bunch of his memos, a bunch of, like, certain slack posts that have been indicative of, like, his thought patterns. And so it's got a profile for how he thinks. And, you know, what's. You're gonna write a message or. Something. That needs to land is, like, you can just feed that message through and be, like, you know, help optimize the structure so that it's presented in a way that Adam is able to consume.  
Me: Love it.  
Them: And it is. Already spot on. I mean, I usually take it and, like, rewrite it a little bit to make it sound.  
Me: Okay? I haven't gotten around to making one.  
Them: Prompt formatting? I guess. I don't know.  
Me: Yeah. I can see that.  
Them: And I think Adam has some things, like in the project, like, he has some things that he. React. Share it now and tell me. Feel free to look over it.  
Me: Awesome. I think. One of my, like, biggest. What I find myself worried about with Adam is. Like. Overthinking or slowing anything down. On the product side, like, slowing. He's like, Wants to follow intuition and go do the thing. And I think it's important to balance that out with some real product thinking. But I just fear that his immediate reaction to everything is gonna be, oh, that's gonna take forever, or doesn't want to spend the time or let us spend the time on the product thinking. So I don't know if you've had similar. If I'm off base with that assumption. As a concern or. Yeah. Ideas for how to soften the. Amount of effort it might take to put proper product thinking into a given thing.  
Them: Yeah, it's tricky. I think it's like. The theme that I think needs to happen across the company.  
Me: Is more just. Bearing versus.  
Them: Versus like asking for permission. And he knows he has a horrible habit of, like, underestimating how hard something is. Like, that has come up again and again, like Granola told him, too.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah.  
Them: My Granola told him, and his Granola told him, too. It was just, like, really funny because he's like, okay, yo.  
Me: That's. Hilarious.  
Them: So. I think probably there's some planting on flags that could happen. And I can.  
Me: Like, hey, this is your chance. Kind of read by. And like.  
Them: Want the teams to work. You know, like, we started doing some pain points in that figma that you put together for the on site. Off points from that. Because we didn't really go back and look at that. Like, I just have not had time. So it's just one of those things where I think there's nothing. A little bit of, like, a documented operating system for product and design. And maybe help him understand, like sizing. When there's almost like a little decision tree of. Okay, if it's, you know.  
Me: You know? If it's, like, xl and.  
Them: These are probably. He does respond really well with.  
Me: Let you. Okay?  
Them: Rubrics in general, and it's. He's just. He's very like rules based in his thinking.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: It's funny because, like, he's this balance of wild and free, and also, like. Kind of, like, very specific about, like, format.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Yeah, that's what I've noticed as well. Okay, great. Perfect. And then I think, like, At least what I've observed so far. With Craig is almost opposite. He's, like, so deeply thoughtful. That things feel slow. And so I'm trying to figure out the right balance of, like, he seems like he can take a pretty ambiguous idea and run with it. I think that's one of his strengths. At the same time, I feel like he's trying to tell me, like, give me more. What's the problem? Space. What are the. So I'm trying to find a better balance of, like, how to get him what he needs. As early as possible to get him moving a bit quicker, or at least seemingly. I don't know if it's because he's off spinning on his own so much before he's willing to share something. Or if he's truly. Like just doing a lot of pre thinking before putting anything into pixels, but in general it just feels like a pretty slow cadence to like I, I feel a bit naggy with him. Like, hey, anything to share. Hey, anything to share. So I don't know if you. Yeah, same thing. Like Heph had similar experiences have advice there.  
Them: Yeah. I mean. He's been feeling kind of just. Disconnected. You know, is what I would describe it as. And he and I have definitely talked about that, which is, like, okay, he's got, like, weird time zone issues. You know, the overlap is not necessarily right. You know, depending on what's going on. And he's not sure. He's, like, passionate about the space. He is feeling more energized after conversation with Adam and Drew about, like, hey, like, you need to step up and maybe, you know, do more, like, hybrid product thinking. And you're the best at craft. How do you scale that? And this is an opportunity. And so I said to him this morning, like, I think What I would advise you to do is be more decisive. Like, come, come with ideas and that. Be sure you are communicating on a regular cadence about milestones or just, you know, updating on the work because you are good when you do it. You know, it's well written, the looms are helpful. But then, like, you do kind of drop off the radar, which I think is a motivation thing. You know, so there's some days where he just can't, like, kick start the, the motor.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: You know, so, like, legitimately, like, nothing has moved. And you're not wrong with that intuition.  
Me: Gotcha. Yeah. That is what it feels. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. Like, it's just. It's not something he's, like, getting excited about jamming on for. But again, I was like, oh, is it something? Do I need to give him more? Do I need to set up the problem space clearer?  
Them: Or it's too big, or he also has a product knowledge gap. And I have asked him in the past to, like, spend more time. Like, just go set up tests. They don't have to be perfect. Like, just go try things.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. Y. Eah.  
Them: So I don't know if he knows, like, all the. The territory a little bit, and there. There's like, just kind of anxiety. Maybe about, like, can I really solve for something when I don't understand, like, the nuts and bolts of this? You know, and then, like, how far do you take it? Like, how far does it align with the overall strategy? I think I have not spent time with him going through, like, the new pillars like he's been. I mean, I previewed them to him and kind of touched on them, but I didn't go deep with him. On any of those and, like, how they fit together and, like, the OKR stuff, because he was like, you know, how do I plug into these okrs? And I'm like, well, the PM will lead on the OKR process, but ideally, like, they're syncing with the teams and, you know, like. But basically like, feel free to contribute, but. On that one. He wasn't directly responsible for anybody's. Like, you could set up some for just, like, the design practice if you wanted to, in terms of, like, things that you all want to execute on or improve. So I think it's a matter of, like, I mean, you're up early, so actually, the time zone overlap isn't so tough, which, like, is really lucky. So I asked him this morning. I was like, put regular time on the books with Kate.  
Me: Y. Eah.  
Them: And like, you only need to work. Start working as, like, a triad. Like, figure out who's your engineering third. Like, most likely it's Carolyn. And then have like, that as a first team mentality.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And he was like, oh, okay. Yeah. You know, like, I've never really had, like, a dedicated engineering partner the whole time I've been here, because it's been, like, bouncing between Christian or Andrew or Carolyn or just, you know, whatever. Dev is on something.  
Me: Yep, yep. Okay? Cool.  
Them: So. I think if you all are intentional about, like, how do you want to communicate and where do you want to track work and, like, all that stuff, like, actually get it right, like, write it down as, like, your little charter or something. I think that's going to go a long way to, like, everybody having the same expectations.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Cool. Super help. Ful.  
Them: But, yeah, I mean, his motivation does flag from time to time. That's something I've seen over time. And it's like when he's on, he's, like, really good, right? And then there's times where he's been distracted because, like, they're moving house or whatever. And, you know, I think he's coming into a period of stability, hopefully. And basically what I said is, like, go enjoy the holidays. Come back fresh, dig in with your partners and be very decisive and declarative. And just don't ask for permission on anything. Just be like, this is how we're going to do it. You know, obviously, like, you can take feedback from, like, your closest stakeholders, but Adam doesn't get to, like, bush, design around or push product around.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: If he were an expert practitioner, he wouldn't need any of us. You know, it'd just be him on a vibe, coding.  
Me: Yeah. Yep.  
Them: Or whatever. So I've had some blowouts with him, like, over the last couple months, which do not repeat that. But, you know, just like, why would you hire. Talented people. But then not let them operate with things that they know to be best practices.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, like, design Sprint was an example where it was, like, a battle to even get it done. And then they were like, what? It's not a vision sprint? And I'm like, no, because you told us you didn't want us to do vision on our own. Remember, Drew? Like, I almost. I wanted to. Slap him in that meeting when he was like, would be nice to have some vision. I was like, great. You all just published this under great duress, like, two days ago. And literally when I first proposed, like, a product vision Sprint, like, experience vision. When I, I made an agenda for that week and was like, you know, how do you guys want to participate? And they. He got like, his back really up about you all are the ones responsible for vision. Like, vision comes from the founders and. You know? And I was like, all right, well, then you owe it to us, and we will not proceed until we get this. But came down to, like, okay, Adam was all hot on the embedded preview thing, and I was like, no, really, we have to figure out, like, the architecture of this thing. Like, we can't just. Jump in and assume like this is the solve to all of our problems.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And he didn't even want to touch preview like until like I finally kind of beat him down on that in July of like this on site editor experience really sucks.  
Me: Yeah. It's so interesting because he. In my, like, I think now he's the one who's just hardcore. We have to do visual building. We have to do visual building, preview, whatever we want to call it. But then, like. Everything I'm hearing from everyone else is like, well, we don't even know if it will work. So then I asked him, literally this morning, I'm like, hey, should we get an engineer on researching and poc? While Craig and I are thinking through product and design, like, we're not entirely sure what all we can pitch, whatever, and. And he. 's a super weird response. I think it depends on the question and what you're trying to understand. Like, we can look at what competitors do. Obviously, that works. We can ask AI or we could ask one of our engineers. And. And I'm like, we have to do. Like, if you want to do this project, we have to get engineering involved. Soon. I'm not trying to delay the product and design work. I'm just saying, like, we need an engineering partner. To start drinking.  
Them: This is an example of where I wouldn't even ask him. I would just go to Carolyn and be like, you know, how do you want to handle those? Because, like, Carolyn is your partner on sort of the core pillar. Like, that's her name's down next to that, right? So, because he will go in and he will micromanage and he will not understand what people are trying to do, and he will declare everything easy. And I know from a fact, like when we were going through the initial offers progress process, he was the one kind of like, vetting the. The designs. And then Carolyn got them, was like, oh, you know, like, there was definitely things he said, we're, like, totally possible, and, you know, they weren't.  
Me: And. They work.  
Them: And he's like not in the weeds in the day to day. I mean he obviously knowledge of the code base and you know, he sure could go ask Devin like how was this possible or something, but. That. Is a trap. I guess is what I want to say is like asking him. Like, on Next Steps or whatever. I think it's more like, tell him next to us and be like, I've synced with Carol and here's a word. Here's our milestone, and here's what we're doing. And, you know, he will probably ask, like, is there any way to make this go faster, you know? And then it's like, maybe there is, maybe there isn't, and, like, he needs to just start accepting like no is an answer. It's like, no. We're going to keep you updated, but, you know, we'll. We'll pull the plug by this point if we. Don't have solid answer or something, but.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That has been my struggle with him the whole time is like, People give the two of them a lot of deference. And they will have an opinion on anything you ask them about, even if it's not an informed opinion. Right? And then once they've given the opinion, then. Then you're kind of, like, locked into negotiating them out of the opinion. You know, or going along with the dumb thing that they said, right?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Then that like a really tricky position to be in.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? So helpful. Yeah. I'm seeing a lot of that. I don't know, like. Persuasion or confidence in. The thoughts can come across as he's more knowledgeable about the tech. Than anyone else. And yeah, okay.  
Them: Crucial. And Carolyn know everything deeply at this point. And then I would go to them first.  
Me: Cool. Okay? Perfect. That's super, super, super helpful.  
Them: And they actively get annoyed when he interjects and proposes technical solutions because they usually are not actually feasible.  
Me: Yeah. Okay?  
Them: So, like, they have said that to me directly. They're just like, oh, God. Okay, that's feedback. You probably need to figure out how to give him.  
Me: Right. Okay?  
Them: I am suggesting I'm doing like a. A wrap up with Jake at some point. In the next few weeks and I am going to suggest that they get an outside party to run. Anonymous 3 60s. You know, so they get some kind of unfiltered feedback.  
Me: Interesting.  
Them: Because there are a lot of behavioral patterns that are challenging and communication patterns that are challenging, and I think that is what would hold the team back. You know, is like, not knowing how to get leverage out of, like, the great people that you have in front of you.  
Me: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I definitely. See that, okay. Really helpful perspective. And then finally, maybe a little bit easier. Hannah. She like. I. I obviously get a good sense of her strengths. Where she can grow. In general, just more on the people side. Like, I remember when I first started, you made some really helpful. Comments about Carolyn and her personality and she thrives with positive feedback. Anything along those lines that you've learned with Hannah? She does seem like a touchy ish personality and very strong opinions. So those are just some of my initial observations and literally the less than a week of working much closer with her. But, yeah, anything on the personal side that might be.  
Them: He is tricky because she kind of falls into that category of, like, the OGs, right? So there's some people who've just been around, you know, for a long time. And, you know, Christian is an example and Andrew's an example, and they have not always been managed well. I do think that. Adam and Drew, like, let people get away with some behaviors and. Hannah's path has been that she wasn't technically a leadership role when she was, like, head of department for support. And it turns out like she really wasn't operating at a high level. And that was another reason we were like, oh, what if we transition her and get somebody who's got more experience to lead support? And as soon as Hannah moved out, it was very clear she had not built systems. You know, she had been kind of sticking things together by sheer effort.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And just being everywhere. And I think that's the habit she actually has to break because, like, she's still out there reading every support ticket and lurking in the support channels, and, you know, she.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: 's she? Some of it is an instinct to be helpful.  
Me: Y. Ep.  
Them: Like that's part of the review feedback that I'm gonna give is it's time to sort of pivot.  
Me: Y. Ep.  
Them: And your customer closeness is a huge asset, obviously, but. Maybe dedicate yourself to looking at things in a new light, Right? And not having to be the one who's everywhere. Like, I do not think we have to be reading every single support ticket like to be good. At our jobs, you know?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Especially we're meant to start looking at, like, roll ups and, you know, using AI to summarize a little bit. It's like you just don't have to read every single one of them.  
Me: Y. Ep? Yep. Which has also been interesting to see her reactions to, like, Reforge, because she just doesn't think it's, like, accurate. It's not supposed to be, like, A hard and fast. Like, these are the exact things that people. It's like. It's like trend identification, whatever. But she's just so in the weeds that I think some of, like, higher level summaries are just not cutting it for her.  
Them: Yeah. She's just super literal, too. There was something that she said. Like when? After Adam told her or after I told her that she was going to report into you? Like, Adam followed up with her the next day to be like, hey, how's this going? And she was like, oh, I really like Kate. I think she's really easy to work with. And then she said something like. And it was like, lack of attention to detail. And I was like, Adam, like, you have to. Culturally like people who have just been here longer do not get to castigate new people for not knowing every nook and cranny of something.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know? And I dug into that a little bit more, and I think there was some examples, maybe from checkout, that Carolyn had brought up and then sat on the feedback, which was like a Carolyn thing to do, too. And it was, oh, you all looked at, you know, some Shopify docs one day and explored why something could or couldn't work. And then or couldn't work, rather, it was the conclusion. And then Carolyn summarized it the next day, and you were like, wait, why won't that work? You know? And the feeling was like you had had the information, but maybe you didn't totally internalize it. And I was like, honestly, like, this is complicated stuff. You have to give people a pass for just like, not knowing the inner workings of Shopify all the time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So that is very much a Hannah thing. And that's. I'm going to be giving her feedback on that. I was like, hey, you've got to, like, relax a little bit because you've got to see the big picture first. Like, she jumped down my throat on one occasion because I said something about, like, price testing the quantity buttons, and she was, like, her brain locked because she was expecting me to say price testing with offers. And I was like, Yeah, yeah. Price testing works with quantity. Because she was like, price testing doesn't work with quantity buttons. And I was like, it literally does. Like, Carolyn just did it the other day. And she was like, no. What's powering the discount. And I was like, the offer. That the button detached. To, and she going around and around and around because basically, like, I didn't put the coin into the gumball machine in exactly the right way. And I was like, dude.  
Me: Interesting. Yeah.  
Them: Like, actually told her to drop it. I was like, I think, you know, I'll go double check on this. But I do believe that price testing works with quantity buttons. And Shane has done one pagers on it, and Carolyn has verified it. And I'm sorry I didn't say it in the way that. You were hoping I would say it, but maybe give me a little grace on like, you know what I mean? Like, you know that is attached to an offer. Like, you literally cannot put quantity buttons in the to the site without an offer at that.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. Yeah.  
Them: Right? So I'm like. I'm sorry. Like, you know, in the hierarchy of objects, like quantity, buttons did not land at the right level for you or whatever. But, like, I was pissed. Honestly, I was like, really? Like, you're wasting my time with Brand.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Super interesting, and that feedback is fantastic. I could see. I could see that exactly. With her. Even just doing some mixed panel digging. Like, similar. She's like. And when you're talking data, I totally get this, but she wants the number and makes panel to be to the exact as what she's seeing in tableau. And the number of times I've been like, the purpose of mixed panel is different than tableau and Snowflake or whatever. All the things we're using, like, yes. We want it to be pretty darn close. And I'm sure she's like, this is stupid. This is not useful because it's not exact enough. For me. So I've been treading that one. A little bit. Like, yes, I want to inject my opinion about what the purpose of mixed panel is, but also, I know it's driving her nuts. Those things are not. It's driving a lot of people nuts, I think, and we're starting to get there. But it's been challenging to communicate to all of these extremely talented data brains that makes panel is for trend identification and monitoring things and not like here's our hard and fast. Numbers on all the things that we want to be tracking. So, anyway, I've noticed it there, too, and. She's probably going a little nutty as a result of the conversation she's having with me. Yeah.  
Them: She's going to get specific feedback on. You do not have have to always go into the weedy details and like perfection is not the goal.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: So that's absolutely something, like in my notes and basically, like, I'm going to summarize all of my one on ones with her, like have a Granola, summarize, you know, the areas that come up most frequently and I will be shocked if that is not one of them because I've definitely given her feedback like that before. So she has some self awareness. About it, like it's not something that she hasn't heard before, but. I don't know. I think it's like. Maybe developing a shorthand with her on, like, is this an 80% right situation? Or like, does this really have to be 100%, like, are we directional or are we landing on the moon, you know? Like the rocket goes up versus the rocket lands on this coordinate on Mars.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. Okay? Cool.  
Them: Some of that is just personality. I think she's neurodivergent of some flavor. And. You know, obviously, like. She's got quirks. I also think she's been allowed to stay in the leadership circle too long. Like, technically, like, she shouldn't be in the LT channel and she shouldn't be and like tech leadership. And that is an Adam and Drew thing, which is like they over index on putting people into things for context.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: But then it's an impression with that person. You know, so, like, she changed roles from leading a department to being an icpm and in that hierarchy, like, she shouldn't be in those things, right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then that creates drama because it's like, we're so small. Then it's like, honestly, she's, like, the only one left out. But then I think when Jerrica is here, then they'll be like, more ICP. Like, Emily will hire some ICPNs.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You know, and I think that will start to have to shift. You know, with intention.  
Me: Right. Yep. Yep. No, I. Yeah, I see all that. It's. It's interesting. I mean, I remember getting demoted from all those channels when I switched from an engineering team lead to a junior pm. Like it happens. It's the trade off, but. But yeah. Not all. Not also like a battle to fight at this stage of company, I don't think.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I get?  
Them: Well, we're so small, right? So it's kind of like whatever. Like, it is not a hill I decided to die on, but.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: It is something where like over time, like her scope is not going to be everything right Like I do. She also feels like she has license to like poke into any part of the product. And so having like a more scoped mission will definitely be different for her. But my whole theme around the review is going to be focus, right? And, you know, figuring out where you actually need to go deep versus, like, when you can do, you know, sort of just. Just enough.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah.  
Them: She also is not great at interviewing customers. I've noticed, like, she basically is like, tell me what you want. So I want to recommend. Yeah, I was going to recommend an interviewing user and just enough research. You know, which. Like, she'll go read books. Like, she will. Absolutely. You know, she has read everything I've ever suggested to her.  
Me: Cool. Okay? That's good to know. I noticed the same thing. I. I listened to a few of her and Angela's calls on getting this, like.  
Them: And they were, like, so under repaired, and I was like, Okay? Whatever.  
Me: It was. It was pretty bad. I was like, well, here's opportunity for mentorship. That's. That's how I was looking at it. So. Yeah. Okay. Good to hear that you saw the same or notice the same. And then, speaking of focus, that was my last final follow up about Hannah is like, getting her out. Of billing and all the things like. Did you have kind of a rough plan in mind for that at all? Should I lean on Adam to help with that? Like, how do I. Because she said to me directly. That was one of her. She didn't bring up any of the. Like, I'm no longer close to Adam and Drew. All the stuff I heard from you and Adam, that didn't. She didn't say that to me directly. But the one thing she did say that she was worried about is like, how she was going to be freed of. All the other things.  
Them: And it is so funny because, like, she literally sits behind out. I'm like, she could not possibly be more on, out of the radar, you know?  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: So that I personally find funny I ironic, I don't know.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So the plan, obviously, there's a couple parts to it. So one is Jerrica coming in to pick up, like, the APIs and, like, anything in sort of more platform, like the integrations page and like, all those other places Hannah's kind of dabbled. And so that'll be coming off her plate. Her sentiment to me was like, that isn't that much work. And I'm like, that's fine. But we're just. We're creating focus, you know, we're trying to create more single threaded ownership. And then the plan for billing Emily and I have discussed having Emily higher up, who's, like, got some growth monetization skills or wants to grow those. But then also has some billing system experience.  
Me: Okay? Great.  
Them: Yeah. And that is something that I think there will be headcount to have, because I said to Adam, like, we have to accelerate on this. And he was like, let me just check the models. That was before I resigned, so I don't know if he's gotten to do that, but. That is something where it's like, in the new year, that would be, like, my top priority is getting that person, like a. Because customers are having terrible experience with billing, and then our internal teams are having a terrible experience with billing, and then Hannah's kind of bogged down in this world.  
Me: Great. Yeah. Okay? Cool. Good to know.  
Them: So. And I think you can help Emily with the hiring. I don't know that she's. If she's hired a PM before. Or not.  
Me: Yeah, I can definitely help there. Diddle.  
Them: Include, you know, or there's probably, like, somebody from your network or like, a HubSpot has a whole huge, like, billing and fintech team and could be a chance to get somebody, like, a little more junior out of there. But somebody who, like, knows the ropes and wants to step up opportunity.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Good to know. I don't know any off the top of my head. We didn't have. I mean, we had pms who got, quote unquote, stuck with billing. But, like, in general, we didn't have, like, dedicated.  
Them: Yeah. The other option is like, we switched to some kind of service like Metronome. You know, like there's. There's solutions out there. That are specifically for like SaaS billing and like different creative types of SaaS billing. Especially if Adam wants a usage based component moving forward, like right now, like, that's impossible in the current system, like without like a bunch of rework, from what I understand.  
Me: Yeah. Okay?  
Them: So I would just try to steer clear. Just be like, no speak, Billing. I'm sorry. Stay away. Like 100 foot call. Get sucked in.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, I really don't speak billing, so I think it'll be pretty easy for me to put on that front. Cool. Okay, I think that covers it. So then, like. Yeah, We've talked about all the people now like me, similar, like. As candid as you can be, like, as blunt as you want and could be, is super helpful for me. And just like anything you've heard from other people, anything you've observed in the last five months, That might help for me to be cognizant of moving forward from here.  
Them: I mean. The attention to detail feedback like, take that or leave that. Right. Like, there, it could be worth maybe investing more time and just catching up on Shopify docs. And, you know, just obviously, I think you're really good at spending time in the product and, like, you really went for it with your data store. You could potentially work with Shane on his merch store. Like, that might be useful to have, like, an actual, like, working store. So I do think that is currency around here, is like, having product knowledge, right? And having knowledge of, like, specific customers, which, like, I think you've met a lot of them, like, through the checkout process, which is really great. But that is definitely, like, an unlock in terms of, like, having specific customer relationships. So I would definitely try to build those. And that's one where one place where, like, Hannah gets away with, you know, some things because it's like she can just, you know, George and Willie, or they'll be like, oh, yeah, of course I'll take her call. And, like, she's got personal. Relationships with a lot of these people, so that's something that I think is useful. And I talked to Matt about and I'm sure he would be happy to pick this up. Is like having product right up front in the sales product process, not for solutioning purposes, but for like, hey, let me tell you about our roadmap or let me help with like, discovery around needs because our sales team is not good at discovery conversations.  
Me: Yeah. Okay?  
Them: You know, that could be really cool because then you would have, like, a relationship, like, from the start. You know, if somebody goes and converts.  
Me: Y. Ep.  
Them: And then it's like, okay, you have a friendly face like they've seen you before, and you can reach out to them in their slack channels and things like that. So that would be just a good move in general, like, that's something that I've struggled with, is like, having specific customer relationships because like, the nature of, like, how I spent my time was, like, not necessarily conducive to that, but that was. The solve I landed on was, like, in talking to Matt, like, hey, could we do this? And he was like, yes, let's figure it out. And then it kind of died out because it seemed like, one of those things where he sort of felt like he had to go ask permission. And I was like, no, you don't like, let's just try it.  
Me: Yeah. Okay?  
Them: So I think that would be super useful and.  
Me: Perfect.  
Them: Yeah. I think the other thing is just keeping up. Like, I think you're good about giving the updates. They love a performative update. Like, they just do and, like, more detail, the better. Just bury them in details. It's, like, not necessarily helpful for the team. So I'm sort of a monster for saying this. But I think that was also feedback I gave Craig, which is, like, keep up the cadence so that people have insight into, like, what's going on. So it feels like it's moving, and that actually can kind of head off some of the things, like, It's. It's like you were telling what's happening versus, like, asking permission for, like, should we do this and should we do that next, right? But it's very visible and it's very public, and they're going to feel like, wow, things are moving a million miles an hour, right? So if it's like, all right, we're doing this, and Ken was doing this, and we're, we're tag teaming, we're parallel pathing. And then that's awesome.  
Me: Yeah, it's a really good call. I. I can be better. More work more in public, if you will. Definitely you can improve. There.  
Them: Yeah, I think that's useful. I mean. If there's any other projects that you're doing that are important projects but maybe aren't on the radar, I think it's also good to report on those, like the, the POC stuff, you know, with we tried build better and here's an update and stuff like that. Or maybe some of the mixed panel work, like, almost track that, like a project and report on that. I think that's really useful so people understand, like, here's all the places. This one's time is going, and she's really busy, you know.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Cool.  
Them: But beyond that, I mean, I think, yeah, building relationship with Hannah, building a relationship with Jerrica, which will be super easy. She's so, so nice. You could offer to have. Adam has told her that about the recording change. I can give you her email if you want to reach out and be like, hi, we're. Gonna be working together. You know, I think that'd be good.  
Me: Yes, that would be fantastic, if you don't mind.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: When? Starting. What's our start? Date.  
Them: In January 5th.  
Me: Okay, so first day back, okay?  
Them: Yeah. And so onboarding, Doc? I was gonna do, like, a shell, basically, and kind of a work in progress on, I think, the ones that we did for you and Angel. We haven't had anybody else on the team start then, but, like, maybe take that, remix that parallel down a little bit, see if there's. Any more information that needs to go in there like Hannah, I'll ask Canada to drop in like. Stuff about the API and the mcp server and, like, all that.  
Me: Great. Great. Sorry. I hate when delivery people ring. Hang on one second. Someone just rang. One sec.  
Them: Signature. You should go.  
Me: Oh, my. Goodness. I am so sorry.  
Them: Oh, you're fine. I'm sending you something, and I'm typing to you right now, actually.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Let's. See? I realized I actually cannot share my cloud project because I do not have a team plan.  
Me: I was just gonna hear. I was, like, gonna ask at the very end. I'm like, I don't see it, but okay.  
Them: Yeah, I thought I could, and then I couldn't find an access point, and I was like. So I checked. It's like, they make you have a team plan, which makes sense, but then it's a minimum of five seats for a team plan, and I'm like,  
Me: O. H.  
Them: So I just sent you sort of the context, basically.  
Me: Perfect. Thank you.  
Them: Which is useful. And, like, I can. I can say what I have in the context and maybe, like, pull that out.  
Me: Yeah. I mean, don't spend too much time. I can go grab some stuff on my own, too. But yeah, anything that you think is kind of core to the context would be helpful, but.  
Them: I really wish there was a way to bulk download like all the files that are in.  
Me: I know. Too.  
Them: Annoying.  
Me: Yes, agreed.  
Them: So. I can cut and paste what I have into, like, one big Google Doc and. That's fine. That won't take that long.  
Me: But, I mean, yeah, don't spend ages.  
Them: It'll be helpful. And I didn't build it past, like. May or June maybe, I think into June. So there's been some memos that he's written since then that are not in here and things like that, so.  
Me: Okay? Okay?  
Them: There's more you could add if you wanted to make one.  
Me: For sure. Awesome. Thank you so much for that. I appreciate it.  
Them: Yeah. It's been beyond useful. And, like, so creepy. I, like, literally cannot tell people.  
Me: Oh, I know. Well. I. I have the starts of these things. For the same reason. But yeah, same I have not shared with others.  
Them: I. Mean? That's a thing. Like, I listen to that how I AI podcast, which I really like, is she's got some good. And she mentioned the other day it's like called Synthetic Boss. And I was like, oh, that has a name.  
Me: Yeah. There's definitely a lot of people that do it. We are not the only ones. Cool.  
Them: No, the barrier is like, the context gathering, because it's such a pain in the butt to, like, feed it in there.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: Or it be a killer product in there somewhere if it could, like, automatically.  
Me: Thinking about that the other day. Actually, this, like, talk about keep between ourselves, this is, like, ultimate creepy. Now. I asked their permission for it, but I like, record the kids therapy sessions. Because I have to sit in there with them. Like it's. It's just me and the therapist and the kids.  
Them: Oh. Wow.  
Me: But she says stuff that I always forget. Like, how did she say we should frame that thing or whatever. It's, like, very informative for us. But then I want to create projects. To be like. What would Colleen say when my kid asks me this thing or when my kid has this problem? But I wanted those to feed in automatically, too. It's like, oh, if it's Elsie. Send it to this project. If it's Finley's into this project. It was me. Send it to that project. Anyway.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. I'm also one of those people that, like, zero, clearly, like, not many privacy concerns. I'm like, Anyway. I'm, like, letting Granola record therapy sessions. That's. How.  
Them: Oh, Kim does that, too.  
Me: It's just. It's just so helpful. I need. I need all the stuff, and I want to be able to reference it, and I have, like, kids will be a thing, and I'm like. What would Colleen say?  
Them: I got a really good idea.  
Me: Anyway.  
Them: To find a new therapist. I have been on a break for a good couple months, and I'm like, I want a new one.  
Me: I just started again. Like, literally last week.  
Them: Intelligems drove you to it.  
Me: No, no, it wasn't Intelligems. I just like. Yeah. Like.  
Them: Parenting is really hard, too.  
Me: All the things. Yeah, I mean, I think I told you. I was like, it's not no, like, big thing. It's just, like, piling up of, like, kids stuff. And, you know, work stuff and family stuff and nothing. Yeah, nothing. Intent, like, not being able to work out anymore. Knees, like stupid, silly stuff. Any. Way. So here we are.  
Them: You know? One thing that happened that was really funny is, like, so when we moved to California, Harper had some, like, adjustment issues. And we got her a therapist. And this lady was the sweetest. She was, like, maybe 5ft tall, and she wore, like, red Converse, and she had tattoos and, like, white blonde hair, and she was kind of like a little punk rock edge. And Harper just loved her. Like, she was a very good therapist and, you know, very. Insightful and empathetic. And then after we moved back, obviously she couldn't work outside of California and do telehealth with us. So it was like we found her a new therapist, and so she was like, it's not. It's not her.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And I was like, Okay, I'm sorry. And so then she just, like, systematically tortured that therapist. And then, like, so we tried another one. She tortured that one. We tried another one. Like, she just, like. She was like, no. Pe. No.  
Me: I'm a little worried about that. I mean, I'm thrilled that we found one that the kids love. She's amazing. Similar, like, older woman. She's got some awesome hair and big glasses, and she's just kooky. And the girls love her. Like, they love going to chat with her. She's funny. And I'm like, man, this was not my first experience in therapy. And now this is going to be their bar, and they're never going to go back if they can't find another volume. Yeah.  
Them: PE I don't know my kid is a forced but she we love.  
Me: Of. Course.  
Them: Most devious little mind. Which shouldn't surprise me, given how much time I spend on human behavior, but I don't know. But basically, like, I think you're gonna do great. I think it really is just that line with, like, when do you demonstrate best practices versus, like, sharing? I think this would be the best next step. But, like, acting like you need his input. Right. And it's a balance because, like, you want to get close to him and you want to build rapport and trust. And all of that. And I think the one way to do that is definitely, like, the performative update route. That gives him great peace of mind. And Drew as well. If they just feel like they owe everything, they have to drop that. Like that's not healthy for them. Right.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: But I'm saying, like, for now, that is a lever you could pull.  
Me: Yeah. That's. Yeah, great advice. And it's funny, too, because I was talking to, actually, my old manager from Customario. Recent. Ish. In the last few weeks. And was talking. I think I mentioned something about how almost resistant at first Drew and Adam were to, like the whole vision thing. And then Adam asked me. Like I feel like I'm getting placated. Like everyone loves this vision, and I don't understand why it feels the same.  
Them: That.  
Me: And anyway. Brian, my old manager, made a really. Perfect point. He was like, the purpose of a vision is so that. You don't have to make all the decisions so that you're guiding the rest of the team. To make strong decisions because you all know where you're heading or whatever. And I'm like, that's a really good point. And they are a little too in the weeds still. And. That's kind of why. And that might be part of the resistance on the vision stuff is they don't. They didn't quite understand that it would free them of a lot of that, or they're not ready to be freed.  
Them: I think it's just they're not ready. Like, there's, like, this control mindset and, like, almost like a scarcity mindset. And, like, I get it. Like, they worked really hard to be where they are, and I'm sure, like, great personal sacrifice. And then, you know, through hard times of their lives when they. They had, like, young babies, and it's just like, it's a tough season.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And I. I understand, like, feeling like you can't let go or feeling like no one's going to do it the way you will, but there's also, like. You know, as you age, you're like, I am. I'm going to actively not try to be the smartest person in the room. I'm going to get everybody who's smarter than me. You know, like, that's how I succeed, is if I get people who are better than me, right?  
Me: Totally.  
Them: They just haven't gotten there yet.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: And they, I think, will and. I have not given them any feedback. I have a bunch compiled. They want to do some kind of exit interview. And I'm thinking about, like, how to distill this down, but, like, probably my biggest feedback is, like, get out of the way.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like you're actually hindering things and you don't realize it. You have the best intentions, but this is what needs to shift if you want to really accelerate.  
Me: Y. Eah. Yeah. Cool.  
Them: Yeah. So I'm. I'm going to frame it around going faster because I think they love that, but.  
Me: Awesome.  
Them: That's what it is. It's like, get out of the way.  
Me: Yeah. Love that. Incredible. Yeah. As usual, this is wildly helpful. I'm so grateful for all of that. Context, feedback, transparency, all the things.  
Them: Yeah. If this doesn't go well, come talk to me. Promise me we'll come talk to me as soon as possible.  
Me: Of. Course, yes. Absolutely.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You will hear from me. I also have like since leaving customario. Like a silver lining. And all that was like, these were people that I worked very, very closely with for a really long time. And I was like, I have got to stay in touch with people that I have worked with. In the past, and so it's going to go the same for you. As like I feel like you've been in our short time, we built a super, super awesome relationship, and I don't want that to go away. So you'll be hearing from me.  
Them: Yeah. Oh. I feel so lucky to have met you and worked with you. Like, I've learned a lot from you, too. And honestly, like, you know, as soon as I talk to you the first time, I was like, this is the one for sure. You know, it's like, you're obviously, like, going to be an anchor. In this team. And. You know, this is a great opportunity to step up and take over more. Like, absolutely. Like, I know that was sort of like your growth path. I definitely did not anticipate. Leaving. You know, back when we were talking like it was nowhere on my radar.  
Me: Sure.  
Them: And it was really only in, like, the last couple of weeks where it was like, oh, this could be real. And then it was like, oh, this is tangible. Oh, you know, this is decision time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So. I don't know. Having a couple conversations just kind of, like, sneaks up on you. It's. Is what it turns out. But that was the hardest thing, is, like, leaving the team. And, like, Angela and Angela were, like, both sad and, like, I feel like I'm a jerk, but, like, I will absolutely keep in touch. And, you know, I think it's like just. Yeah, text when something's on your mind, like there's no bad time, you know?  
Me: Yeah. Thank you for that. Same to you. If there's anything. A little backwards, but. Yeah, like, if there's anything that for you that I can be helpful with, like, Same. Same goes there, too.  
Them: Yeah. Of course. Go Spend more time with Kim, too. I told her. I was like, I need you to spend more time with Kate. Please. Like Yoshini's sounding board.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: Jen Thompson is amazing, by the way.  
Me: Yes.  
Them: She is the relationship to build.  
Me: Yeah. Both of them are on my mind, especially after, because Jen and I got to chat quite a bit, like, kind of later, New York City, which was fantastic. And I was like, I have got to carry this forward, too. Yeah. So.  
Them: Too. Yeah, she's the coolest.  
Me: Yes, she is. Cool. Amazing. Well, I know we'll talk at least briefly, at least one more time, but thanks.  
Them: Yeah, we'll kick you out. We'll do something, like, in the next couple days.  
Me: For. Sure. All right.  
Them: All right.  
Me: Thanks, ellen.  
Them: Bye.
