Date: Dec 16

Transcript:
 
Them: I like that Bronco sweater.  
Me: Oh, thanks. I just got it.  
Them: That's very cool.  
Me: Thank you.  
Them: Yeah, I'm good. Trying to. I need to get a haircut before I have to New Mexico. It's like hot weather. How was the holiday party last night?  
Me: It's good. Yeah. It's fun to meet some more people in person. And, yeah, Donald did a great job planning. Cool little spot we went to and had, like, the whole place to ourselves. Yeah, it was great.  
Them: That's fun. Yeah. Adam said it was a good time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Well, I just wanted to grab new and light. Know the helen news. I imagine you and Adam caught up yesterday.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But, yeah. Wanted to see how you're feeling and just say. It's a bummer. Like surprising. But also. I don't know. I feel like I'm very pumped about going into next year. And in a lot of part, it's like the systems and the team that we felt this year, which is not changing at all. So I'm still really excited. It is change, I think. Adam probably said this, but he and I. Are very excited that you and Craig have. Are here and have had time to ramp up and now have a chance to step up. And we're not planning on backfilling the role right now. We feel like we kind of have the teams and the people. So I'm excited to get to work more closely with you. Every time we have, it's been great. And I think it should be a good opportunity, I think. Just spoke with Craig, but my encouragement would be like, use us. We are here to help you guys. Put your brains to work in the most impactful way possible. And so some of that is like pushing and studying the direction and challenges, but it's also like making sure you have what you need, be that. Support, resources, time, connections with other teams unblocking so. You report to adam. I have my sideways into product. I'm excited to get to work with you more closely. Hopefully that's mostly a good thing. And just like, yeah, please do not hesitate to use this because you're awesome and incredibly valuable to the company now, and no layer in between anymore.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Probably be some things I'll loop you into at, like, the leadership level. I'm trying to figure out what arcade it's there, looks like, which will be tactical, but. Yeah, that's the main thing I wanted to say, but kind of curious how you're feeling and digesting the news.  
Me: Cool. Yeah. Thank you for all that. And thank you for the feedback. Similar, I mean. Like, super, super bummed just because Helen's awesome.  
Them: She's great. Yeah.  
Me: Was super helpful to work with. She was. I felt like just kind of really had my back, and we had great. Collaboration. So that part's a huge bummer, but. I'm also seeing the opportunity in it. I mean, to your point, to be closer, work closer with you and Adam is very exciting to me. And just to continue to kind of advance my career and impact here. Is kind of why I'm here to begin with. Like, I always thought that was possible. And, you know, step one was, like having director ports. So, like, that's been super exciting to me, even just in the week since that change happened. I'm feeling very energetic and excited to do the mentorship side of the role. Continue to put more systems in place. Yeah. For. For the product team, which is always energizing as well.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then. Yeah, the product side, of course. Just like working closer with Adam. And pushing pretty hard. For. Impactful change, product wise too. Like all of it. Excites me so. I'm still as excited, if not more, potentially not negative, toward in the least bit. But the more. Yeah, I'm just after impact, I just get really excited about the opportunity.  
Them: Yeah. In the step into the ring even more.  
Me: What's that?  
Them: To step into the ring even more.  
Me: Yeah, exactly. That's always been a motivator for me, and so I'm just kind of seeing that side of this bummer change instead of getting too wrapped up in negatives.  
Them: Yeah. Kind of same. It's like I'm so grateful that we had Helen for a year. And thanks to her, we are now also like very equipped. To keep building without her. Yeah. How. How's it been going with Hannah so far?  
Me: Good, I think. I. I have just as much to learn from her as she does. For me, just her product knowledge and customer closeness will be huge. So just collaborating with her more closely. Similar with Adam is, like, very nice. That was one thing, maybe like, you know, Helen. And Helen was new ish too, even when I started. And so I think just her product knowledge. We. We both had a lot to do in that area, so it'll be nice to be a little bit closer to both Adam and Manhattan. To soak in more of that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I see a ton of opportunity, too. In guiding and mentoring her, like, from the product side of the house. Like, we've talked through objectives and krs. So there was good opportunity to push, like, The roadmap shouldn't be defining our krs, for example. It should be the other way around, like, stuff like that. So, yeah, I think it's going well so far.  
Them: Cool. Yeah, she's great. I mean. I think you guys will be a very powerful combo. And, you know, I think. When I. When did we move her to product? I guess it was the spring. I don't know. Time moves very quick. You know she. Built quite. A lot of organizational rep in support. And it was kind of like, hey, you can keep. Growing here and be a manager of managers and like that be your path faster or if you want to go into product and, like, learn a new craft. You can do that. And, like, I think she's just in a very good position with you to, like, actually learn the crafts alongside using all her product knowledge and stuff, so.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Ep.  
Them: Yeah. I'm excited that you guys are working together.  
Me: Y. Eah. Should be good.  
Them: Any like, go ahead.  
Me: Go ahead. I just said should be good.  
Them: Any like. And you can answer this later as you digest. But like any organizational holes you see at the moment, or like. Things you think we should be working on that we're not, or things that we shouldn't be working on that we're planning to.  
Me: No, I wouldn't say holes, necessarily. I was telling Adam there's this fine line, which I'm. I do want to kind of pick Helen's brain about it before she's actually out the door, but.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: What her, like, longer term vision for the org was because I'm just curious. But. There's this fine line between, like. Building out like a full. Product team. Of like product people. And just. Having your product team be just. Just builders, like, just people who want to build great stuff.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Which is what excites me about Hannah and even Jerrica, from what I've heard.  
Them: Y.  
Me: And then like, Jerry. Yeah, exactly. It's like, how do we. So it's more like, how do you form that into a team that has good product guidance?  
Them: Eah, jerry of that.  
Me: But doesn't squash their actual skill sets, which is, like, for Hannah, like, customer closeness, support. For Jerrica, it's like putting things together. For Jerry, it's like data. Brilliant. So how do you like.  
Them: Y. Es.  
Me: Put the right product framing behind all of that and guide in the right direction without being like you're gonna turn into a product manager.  
Them: Yeah, yeah.  
Me: That's kind of what's on my mind is more like, I think, you know, with Hannah and Jerrica, that's gonna be easy and solvable. Their strengths will shine no matter what. I think it's more like questions in my mind is, like, how you pull in, like, Andrew, Jerry, Michael, like, who are kind of doing product work, but not officially product people, not officially on the product team. But give them the product guidance they need, like the product resource. Maybe it's not even necessarily unless they're interested in it, but it's not even necessarily like mentoring them to have product skills. It's more just like give again, giving them the guardrails and the help that they need to make sure it's.  
Them: Y. Eah.  
Me: Like, usable. And viable and all the things that product people do. So that's kind of biggest question on my mind. But I don't think. There are blatant gaps. At the moment, it's more just. Everyone's new. All of these shifts are new. How do you settle people in? In a way, and with a cadence that feels right.  
Them: Yeah, yeah. Then I also feel like. With AI it's like, how do you like, there's. There probably is some convergence between traditional product and building, and it's like,  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: What? You want to let people run and just do. Because, like, I. I do bias towards, like, put it in front of people and see what happens.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Which is cheaper than ever with AI. But then, like, I also. Feel like, then you can have a really distinctiveness in the market from something that's, like, crafted well. And maybe done more quickly, so I. I don't.  
Me: I definitely like. Yeah, definitely. Don't mistake my comments for not crafted well or not polished or not delightful. It's more like. Again, providing the tools to those people, still letting them, like lead the project or initiative or whatever is they're passionate about, but making sure they have.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The tools necessary. So if you're a more product minded person, make sure you have a strong engineer and data and you know, design alongside of you. Or if you're a jre, you make sure you have UX and product minds involved too or whatever. The gaps are in your skill sets. Like, bringing those in instead of saying, like, oh, we're gonna go out and find. All the people to fill all of those gaps all the time.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: It's more like. I think we have them all here. And the passions are in the right area. But it's just. Like complementing those strengths with little bits of the other ones as well.  
Them: Yeah. And because that's also what, like, threads it together as a product or a platform. So just a bunch of random. Features. Yeah. I mean, you should definitely talk with Helen about that, because. I'm fully supportive of that, and. Like. I think you're the natural one to be the key source of influence there. And I think you're in. Craig's relationship will be really important. You guys already worked together quite a bit, but, like, it's the same set of things on design. And how do we, like, make sure that that three designer and six pillars like that, that. Is fusing and available. To everyone as they build.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And I think together, you guys can kind of, like, Talking, like, bring a perspective to Adam on, hey, here's how we're going to, like, Infuse this. And maybe since it's not all Helen's team, here's how we're going to, like, centralize this. But I think we're looking for. For the two of you to really be. Like. Leaders. On product and design and the influence of that because I. I also think Adam and I are pretty like. Pretty objective that, like. Those are not. Our strengths like we haven't been. Classically trained in that. And our last company via. Was like, just. No product and design sense. Like. Like negative in the classic. Like, it's a very stereotypical Israeli company where great underlying tech and then, like. No attention to detail on. On how it's delivered. So I think we're looking forward to learning from you. And we'll push and we'll probably. And we'll do this, but, like, that's how we understand and, like. I'm personally excited to, like, learn more from you guys on it, too.  
Me: Awes. Ome.  
Them: And my role of, like, how can it be faster? And, you know, cheaper and better. And you guys will be like, well, you can pick two or three. Like, here's our options.  
Me: Yeah. Cool.  
Them: But yeah. Like. Let me know.  
Me: Sounds. Good. Cool.  
Them: How. I can as we figure it out.  
Me: Thank you. Yeah, same. And please don't hesitate to push back the feedback. Critical or otherwise. Like, I eat that up. So please don't ever hesitate to hold anything back.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And, yeah, looking super forward. To 2026 and working closer with y'all.  
Them: Same. Cool. All right. Thanks for the time. I'll talk to you very soon.  
Me: Yeah, thanks. See ya.  
Them: Bye.
